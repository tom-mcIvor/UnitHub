# Test Expansion – Documents Workflow & AI Reminder

**Status**: Completed  
**Test Count**: 163 → 197 tests (+34)  
**Coverage**: 36.57% → 49.03% overall (+12.46%)  
**All Tests**: ✅ Passing (`npx jest --runInBand`, `npx jest --coverage --runInBand --silent`)

---

## Summary

- Added comprehensive RTL coverage for the Documents experience (listing, filters, upload modal, metadata form, detail view, lease extractor).  
- Added tests for the rent AI payment reminder button to assert fetch, state transitions, and clipboard behaviour.  
- Covered the communications form workflow (create/update/error paths) and stabilised loading states for dashboard routes.  
- Introduced minor accessibility improvements (`aria-label` attributes) on document action buttons so they are discoverable and testable.

## What Changed

| Area | Files | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Documents dashboard UI | `components/documents/__tests__/documents-page.test.tsx` | Covers filtering, modal toggles, delete workflow, and empty/error states. |
| Upload modal | `components/documents/__tests__/document-upload.test.tsx` | Exercises Supabase client mocks, happy path, upload failure, and cancel/reset. |
| Metadata form | `components/documents/__tests__/document-form.test.tsx` | Validates create/update flows, success banners, and error handling. |
| Detail view | `components/documents/__tests__/document-detail.test.tsx` | Ensures extracted data display and edit modal hand-off. |
| Lease extractor | `components/documents/__tests__/lease-extractor.test.tsx` | Simulates async extraction timer and import callback. |
| AI reminder button | `components/rent/__tests__/payment-reminder-generator.test.tsx` | Confirms API payload, render states, and clipboard copy timer. |
| Accessibility tweaks | `components/documents/documents-page.tsx` | Added descriptive `aria-label`s on edit/download/delete buttons. |
| Communications form | `components/communications/__tests__/communication-form.test.tsx` | Drives happy-path, edit, error, and validation flows. |
| Loading states | `app/(dashboard)/*/__tests__/loading.test.tsx` | Smoke coverage for documents, rent, maintenance, communications, tenants skeleton views. |

## Current Gaps & Related Risks

- **Overall coverage still below roadmap target (49.03% vs 60% goal).** UI-only helpers (`components/ui/**`) remain untested, leaving most shadcn primitives without safety nets.
- **App shell files (`app/layout.tsx`, `(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) remain untested.** Any navigation or provider regressions will slip through.
- **Jest worker crash persists when not using `--runInBand`.** CI or contributors using `npm test` may hit unexplained worker exits.
- **No integration/E2E coverage.** The new unit tests rely on mocked Supabase/OpenAI behaviour; storage + network issues would still surface only in higher environments.

## Suggestions (Unverified)

1. **Stabilise the test runner**: Update `package.json` scripts (or `jest.config.js`) to force `--runInBand` or lower `maxWorkers` until the worker crash is diagnosed. Investigate logs from `node_modules/jest-worker` to trace the crashing suites.
2. **Target remaining red coverage zones**: Start with smoke tests for shadcn wrappers (`components/ui/dialog.tsx`, etc.) and the app shell layouts. Even rendering snapshots will lift coverage without heavy mocking.
3. **Introduce integration smoke tests**: Use the existing Supabase test client to verify a full document upload action (metadata only) and ensure router refresh logic is wired.
4. **Plan for E2E around AI flows**: Playwright tests for document lease extraction + rent reminder can validate the wiring beyond mocked responses.

## What Was Tried

- Ran the full suite with `npx jest --runInBand` and again with coverage reporting; both succeeded when executed sequentially.  
- Attempted the default `npm test` script; it still crashes because Jest spawns multiple workers.

## Deferred Work

- Did **not** update the `npm test` script or Jest configuration to enforce single-threaded runs.  
- Did **not** add integration/E2E coverage; focus stayed on unit/component breadth inside the documents workflow.  
- Did **not** refactor shared test utilities; existing mocks are inline per suite.

## Next Steps

- Align the test runner defaults so contributors do not need to remember the `--runInBand` flag.  
- Continue raising coverage across `app/layout.tsx`, untested `loading.tsx` routes, and the `components/ui` primitives.  
- Revisit integration/E2E milestones listed in the testing roadmap once the remaining unit gaps are closed.
