# Communications Server Action Edge Cases – November 1, 2025

**Session Goal**: Refactor `app/actions/communications.ts` tests to the per-test Supabase mocking pattern and close missing error coverage  
**Result**: Overall coverage 57.62% (+0.78%), server actions 93.97% statements (+5.14%), 278/278 tests passing ✅  
_(Current suite total: 289/289 passing after subsequent UI toast work; historical counts retained for this session.)_
**Key Files**: `app/actions/__tests__/communications.test.ts`

---

## What Was Implemented

- Rebuilt the communications server-action suite around a helper that fabricates a fresh Supabase mock per test, mirroring the recent rent/tenants/documents pattern.
- Added explicit scenarios for each exported action:
  - `getCommunicationLogs`: happy path mapping, Supabase error object, unexpected `createClient` rejection.
  - `getCommunicationLog`: record found, Supabase `.single()` error, unexpected rejection.
  - `createCommunicationLog`: validation failure, Supabase insert error, unexpected rejection, and success verifying `revalidatePath`.
  - `updateCommunicationLog`: validation failure, Supabase update error, unexpected rejection, and success with revalidation.
  - `deleteCommunicationLog`: Supabase delete error, unexpected rejection, and success revalidation.
- Confirmed the mapping respects fallback tenant display values (`Unknown`, `N/A`) so consumer components keep their safeguards.

## Current Coverage Snapshot

| Area | Statements | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Overall | **57.62%** | +0.78% from this session |
| Server actions (`app/actions/**`) | **93.97%** | Communications now 100% lines, 85% branches |
| `app/actions/communications.ts` | **100% lines / statements** | Remaining uncovered branches at lines 30-31, 59 (tenant fallbacks) |

**Test Count**: 278 total (+12)  
**Command Used**: `npx jest --runInBand --coverage`

## Problems Still Present

### 1. Coverage Target Still Short (57.62% vs 60%)
- Maintenance server actions continue to use legacy mocks and miss error branches.
- **Suggestions** *(may not be the final fix)*:
  1. Apply the new pattern to `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts` to gain ~1-1.5%.
  2. Add smoke/interaction tests for key `components/ui/**` wrappers to pick up the remaining delta.

### 2. Console Noise During Coverage
- Exercising error branches emits `console.error`, cluttering CI output.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Wrap suites with `jest.spyOn(console, 'error')` and silence via `mockImplementation`.
  2. Replace inline `console.error` calls with a logging helper that checks `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

### 3. Jest Worker Instability
- `npm run test:coverage` still crashes unless we specify `--runInBand`.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Update the npm scripts so `--runInBand` is automatic.
  2. Investigate whether lowering `maxWorkers` or upgrading Jest resolves the issue.

## What Was Tried

1. Dynamic Supabase mock factory: yielded stable, isolated tests.
2. Validation assertions: matched the server action’s raw FormData coercion to avoid false negatives.
3. Full suite run via `npx jest --runInBand` (278 tests) and coverage via `npx jest --runInBand --coverage`.

---

## Deferred Work

1. Bringing maintenance server actions up to the same coverage pattern.
2. Quieting `console.error` output in error-path assertions.
3. Direct branch coverage for the tenant fallback logic (lines 30-31, 59) by simulating missing tenant joins.

---

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Update `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts` with the per-test Supabase pattern to finish server-action parity.
2. Amend npm test scripts to include `--runInBand` to avoid contributor friction.
3. Add a focused test for `mapDbToCommunicationLogWithTenant` with `tenants: null` to cover the fallback branch and raise branch metrics.
