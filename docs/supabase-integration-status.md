# Supabase Database Integration - Implementation Status

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Project Setup
- Extracted V0-generated Next.js app from zip file
- Fixed dependency conflict: Updated `vaul` from `^0.9.9` to `^1.1.2` to support React 19
- Installed all dependencies via npm

### 2. Database Infrastructure
- Created Supabase project (ID: `iwsuwkvndrtkfzmbpmsg`)
- Executed SQL schema from `scripts/01-init-schema.sql` in Supabase
- Created tables: `tenants`, `rent_payments`, `maintenance_requests`, `documents`, `communication_logs`
- All tables have UUID primary keys, foreign key relationships, and performance indexes

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.local` with Supabase credentials:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Created `.env.example` as template (safe to commit)
- Updated `.gitignore` to protect secret files while allowing `.env.example`

### 4. Supabase Client Setup
- Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`
- Created `/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Browser client using SSR helper
- Created `/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server client with cookie handling for Next.js App Router
- Created `/app/api/test-db/route.ts` - Test endpoint that successfully connects to database

### 5. Verification
- Dev server running on port 3000
- Database connection tested and working (returns empty tenant array as expected)
- Code committed to GitHub without exposing secrets

## Current Problems

### 1. UI Uses Mock Data (Not Connected to Database)
**Location**: All component files in `/components/*`

**Issue**: Components like `components/tenants/tenants-list.tsx` have hardcoded arrays (see line 17-57):
```typescript
const tenants = [
  { id: "1", name: "John Smith", ... },
  // hardcoded data
]
```

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Option A: Convert components to Server Components and fetch data directly
- Option B: Create API routes for CRUD operations and fetch from client
- Option C: Use Server Actions (Next.js recommended approach)

**Where to Look**:
- `/components/tenants/tenants-list.tsx`
- `/components/rent/rent-tracking-page.tsx`
- `/components/maintenance/maintenance-page.tsx`
- `/components/documents/documents-page.tsx`
- `/components/communications/communications-page.tsx`

### 2. No Authentication System
**Issue**: Database is accessible but no user authentication exists. All users would see all data.

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Implement Supabase Auth (email/password or OAuth)
- Add auth middleware to protect routes
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to enforce multi-tenant data isolation

**Where to Look**:
- Supabase Dashboard → Authentication
- Would need to create auth components in `/components/auth/`
- Add middleware at `/middleware.ts`

### 3. No CRUD Operations Implemented
**Issue**: Only a test endpoint exists. No way to create/read/update/delete data from the UI.

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Create Server Actions in `/app/actions/` for form submissions
- Or create API routes in `/app/api/tenants/`, `/app/api/rent/`, etc.
- Update form components to call these actions/endpoints

**Where to Look**:
- Forms in `/components/*/` (tenant-form.tsx, maintenance-form.tsx, etc.)
- Would need to add server-side handlers

### 4. AI Features Not Configured
**Issue**: API routes exist at `/app/api/ai/*` but `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set in `.env.local`

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Add OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
- Test AI endpoints for lease extraction and maintenance categorization
- May need to adjust prompts or add error handling

**Where to Look**:
- `/app/api/ai/extract-lease/route.ts`
- `/app/api/ai/categorize-maintenance/route.ts`
- `/app/api/ai/suggest-vendor/route.ts`
- `/app/api/ai/generate-reminder/route.ts`

### 5. Security: API Keys Exposed
**Issue**: Supabase API keys were pasted in chat conversation (now public).

**Solution** (must do):
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
- Click "Reset" on both publishable and secret keys
- Update `.env.local` with new keys
- Restart dev server

### 6. No File Upload Implementation
**Issue**: Document storage UI exists but no actual file upload to Supabase Storage.

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Set up Supabase Storage bucket
- Implement file upload in `/components/documents/document-upload.tsx`
- Store file URLs in `documents` table

**Where to Look**:
- Supabase Dashboard → Storage
- `/components/documents/document-upload.tsx` (currently placeholder)

## What Was Tried

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Initially got React 19 peer dependency error. Resolved by updating `vaul` to latest version instead of using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.

2. **Database Connection Test**: Created simple test endpoint to verify Supabase connection works before proceeding.

3. **Security**: Updated gitignore to use specific patterns instead of `.env*` wildcard to allow `.env.example` while protecting `.env.local`.

---

## What Could Be Done Next (Not Implemented)

1. **Replace Mock Data**: Update one component (e.g., tenants list) to fetch from Supabase as proof of concept
2. **Add Row Level Security**: Write RLS policies in Supabase SQL editor to prevent data leaks
3. **Implement Create Tenant**: Wire up the tenant form to actually insert into database
4. **Add Loading States**: Components need loading/error states for async data fetching
5. **Set Up Auth**: Configure Supabase Auth and add login/signup pages
6. **Type Generation**: Use Supabase CLI to generate TypeScript types from database schema
7. **File Upload**: Implement actual file storage for documents/photos

## File Structure Added

```
/lib/supabase/
  - client.ts          # Browser-side Supabase client
  - server.ts          # Server-side Supabase client

/app/api/
  - test-db/route.ts   # Database connection test endpoint
  - ai/                # AI endpoints (not yet functional - need OpenAI key)

.env.local             # Secrets (gitignored)
.env.example           # Template (committed)
```

## Database Schema Reference

**Tables Created**:
- `tenants` - Tenant profiles and lease info
- `rent_payments` - Payment tracking
- `maintenance_requests` - Work orders
- `documents` - File metadata
- `communication_logs` - Interaction history

**All tables include**:
- UUID primary keys
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete
- Performance indexes on commonly queried fields

See `/scripts/01-init-schema.sql` for full schema.
