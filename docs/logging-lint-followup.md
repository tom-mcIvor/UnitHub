# Logging & Lint Follow-Up

## Implementation Summary
- Normalized delete-handler catch blocks across tenants, rent, maintenance, documents, and communications to log unexpected failures with `console.error` before showing the existing alert. This removed the last batch of unused-variable warnings raised by ESLint.

## Current Issues
- ESLint still reports the legacy unused import in `app/layout.tsx` (`geistMono`) and the `actionTypes` value/type mix in both `components/ui/use-toast.ts` and `hooks/use-toast.ts`. These warnings are outside the scope of the logging change but show up in the same lint runs.
- Node continues to warn that `eslint.config.js` is parsed as an ES module without a `"type": "module"` package flag. Tooling still works, so no change was applied.

## Suggestions (Verify First)
- Remove or repurpose `geistMono` in `app/layout.tsx` to silence the unused import warning.
- Update the toast helpers so `actionTypes` is exported strictly as a type (or renamed) in `components/ui/use-toast.ts` and `hooks/use-toast.ts`.
- Convert `eslint.config.js` to CommonJS or add `"type": "module"` to `package.json` if the Node warning becomes disruptive.

## What Was Tried
- Ran `npm run lint` after the logging updates to confirm the targeted warnings disappeared while keeping the existing user alerts intact.

## Deferred Work
- No changes were made to the toast infrastructure or global layout to avoid ripple effectsâ€”those remain follow-up tasks if you want a completely silent lint run.
