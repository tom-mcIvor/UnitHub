# Component Test Suite Stabilization

This note documents the recent work that aligned the component test suites with the current UnitHub UI. It is intended for downstream AI systems that need an accurate, concise record.

## Implemented Updates
- Brought all component specs (`tenant-form`, `tenants-list`, `rent-payment-form`, `rent-tracking-page`) in sync with the latest UI copy and field structure, ensuring every accessibility query reflects the live markup.
- Added targeted mocks for `next/navigation`, server actions, and the `RentChart` module so the components render without invoking Next.js server-only APIs or heavy charting code.
- Adjusted asynchronous expectations to rely on rendered success banners instead of internal implementation details, yielding stable interactions in jsdom.
- Re-ran the full Jest suite (`npm test -- --runInBand`), confirming 9/9 suites and 53/53 tests now pass.

## Outstanding Problems
- `RentChart` is fully mocked in the tests, so the charting logic remains unverified. This mock was necessary to avoid React act warnings from `ResponsiveContainer`.
- Component tests depend on placeholders and explicit text lookups that could drift with future copy changes.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Consider extracting lightweight unit tests for the data-shaping logic that feeds `RentChart`, or add a Storybook visual test to cover the rendering path.
- Introduce more resilient queries (e.g., test-id hooks or semantic labels) to reduce coupling to display copy.
- Explore an integration test that validates the combined rent dashboard (possibly via Playwright) so mocked pieces are exercised in a browser context.

## Attempts and Deferred Work
- Tried driving the rent payment form submission via low-level form submission and fake timers, but reverted to user-event flows once toast assertions proved sufficient.
- Did not attempt to reintroduce global polyfills such as `whatwg-fetch` after ensuring they were unnecessary for the current suites.
