# Maintenance Server Action Edge Cases – November 1, 2025

**Session Goal**: Align `app/actions/maintenance.ts` tests with the per-test Supabase mocking pattern and cover all failure paths  
**Result**: Overall coverage 58.59% (+0.97%), server actions 99.10% statements (+5.13%), 289/289 tests passing ✅  
**Key Files**: `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts`

---

## What Was Implemented

- Rebuilt the maintenance suite using a per-test Supabase mock factory, preventing shared state across tests.
- Added explicit cases for each exported action:
  - `getMaintenanceRequests`: happy path mapping, Supabase error object, unexpected `createClient` rejection.
  - `getMaintenanceRequest`: record found, Supabase `.single()` error, unexpected rejection.
  - `createMaintenanceRequest`: validation error, Supabase insert error, unexpected rejection, and success verifying `revalidatePath`.
  - `updateMaintenanceRequest`: validation error, Supabase update error, unexpected rejection, and success (including updated timestamp verification).
  - `deleteMaintenanceRequest`: Supabase delete error, unexpected rejection, and success revalidation.
- Confirmed numeric coercion logic by mirroring the server action’s `parseFloat` handling in validation checks.

## Current Coverage Snapshot

| Area | Statements | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Overall | **58.59%** | +0.97% from maintenance session |
| Server actions (`app/actions/**`) | **99.10%** | Maintenance now 100% lines, 72.5% branches |
| `app/actions/maintenance.ts` | **100% lines / statements** | Remaining uncovered branch: fallback tenant mapping in helper (lines 24-38) |

**Test Count**: 289 total (+11)  
**Command Used**: `npx jest --runInBand --coverage`

## Problems Still Present

### 1. Overall Coverage Gap (58.59% vs 60%)
- UI primitives remain lightly covered (~15%), contributing to the remaining 1.41% gap.
- **Suggestions** *(may not be the final fix)*:
  1. Add targeted interaction tests for the most-used shadcn wrappers (`dialog.tsx`, `select.tsx`, etc.).
  2. Cover fallback logic in mapping helpers by simulating missing tenant data.

### 2. Console Noise During Coverage Runs
- Error-path tests still emit `console.error`, cluttering logs.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Spy on `console.error` inside action suites and silence them via `mockImplementation`.
  2. Introduce a shared logging helper that suppresses errors when `NODE_ENV === 'test'`.

### 3. Jest Worker Instability Without `--runInBand`
- `npm run test:coverage` continues to crash unless the flag is present.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Update npm scripts to include `--runInBand` by default.
  2. Investigate lowering `maxWorkers` or upgrading Jest once a patch is available.

---

## What Was Tried

1. Dynamic Supabase mock builder for each scenario; verified stable asynchronous behavior.
2. Validation assertions that mimic the server action’s numeric coercion to avoid false negatives.
3. Full-suite run via `npx jest --runInBand` (289 tests) plus coverage (`npx jest --runInBand --coverage`).

---

## Deferred Work

1. Covering branch logic for tenant fallbacks by returning `tenants: null`.
2. Silencing console errors in tests to keep CI logs clean.
3. Extending interaction coverage to high-usage UI primitives.

---

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Add a focused test for `mapDbToMaintenanceRequestWithTenant` where `tenants` is missing to close the remaining branch gap.
2. Update npm scripts to bake in `--runInBand` and prevent worker crashes for contributors.
3. Begin targeting key UI primitives for interaction coverage to push overall coverage above 60%.
