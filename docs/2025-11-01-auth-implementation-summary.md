# Authentication and Multi-Tenancy Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: ⚠️ OUTDATED - See `google-oauth-multi-tenancy-implementation.md` for current state

> **Note**: This document describes an initial failed attempt. The feature was successfully implemented on 2025-11-02.
> See `docs/google-oauth-multi-tenancy-implementation.md` for the complete, working implementation.

## Feature Attempted (Failed)

The goal was to implement authentication and multi-tenancy in the UnitHub application. This involved:

1.  **Database Schema Changes**: Adding `user_id` columns to the `tenants`, `rent_payments`, `maintenance_requests`, `documents`, and `communication_logs` tables to associate data with a user.
2.  **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabling RLS on these tables and creating policies to ensure that users can only access their own data.
3.  **Server Action Updates**: Modifying the server actions to include the authenticated user's ID in all database queries.

## Files Modified

- `scripts/01-init-schema.sql`: Added `user_id` columns and RLS policies.
- `app/actions/tenants.ts`: Added `user_id` checks to all database queries.
- `app/actions/rent.ts`: Added `user_id` checks to all database queries.
- `app/actions/maintenance.ts`: Added `user_id` checks to all database queries.
- `app/actions/documents.ts`: Added `user_id` checks to all database queries.
- `app/actions/communications.ts`: Added `user_id` checks to all database queries.
- `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts`: Attempted to update the tests to mock the authenticated user.

## Current Problems

The following tests are failing:

- `components/ui/__tests__/dialog.test.tsx`: This test is failing because it cannot find an element with the text "Close" inside an element with the attribute `data-slot="dialog-footer"`.
- `app/actions/__tests__/documents.test.ts`: These tests are failing because the server actions are returning an error message instead of `null`.
- `app/actions/__tests__/rent.test.ts`: These tests are failing because the server actions are returning an error message instead of `null`.

All of these failures are likely due to the introduction of the `user_id` checks in the server actions and the tests not being updated to handle this change.

## Suggested Solutions

1.  **Update the tests**: The tests for the server actions need to be updated to mock the authenticated user. This can be done by mocking the `createClient` function from `@/lib/supabase/server` and having it return a mock Supabase client that includes a mock for `auth.getUser()`.
2.  **Investigate the UI test failure**: The failure in `components/ui/__tests__/dialog.test.tsx` may be unrelated to the authentication changes. It should be investigated separately.

## What I've Tried

- I attempted to update the tests in `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts` to mock the authenticated user, but I was unsuccessful.
- I have reverted all the changes I made to the codebase.

## Next Steps

1.  Fix the failing tests.
2.  Re-implement the authentication and multi-tenancy feature.
