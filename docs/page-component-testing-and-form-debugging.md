# Page Component Testing and Form Debugging

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: In Progress

## What Was Implemented

## Issues Resolved from Previous Testing

### Request is not defined
**Problem**: Detail components importing server action modules caused `Request is not defined` errors in Jest.
**Solution**: Mocked `TenantForm` and `MaintenanceForm` components in `components/tenants/__tests__/tenant-detail.test.tsx` and `components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-detail.test.tsx` to prevent importing server actions during component tests.

### notFound assertion errors
**Problem**: Page tests used `.rejects.toThrowError()` which doesn't exist in Jest.
**Solution**: Changed to `.rejects.toThrow('NOT_FOUND')` in both page test files.

### Missing getTenants mock
**Problem**: `MaintenanceDetailPage` now fetches tenants in parallel for edit dropdown, but test didn't mock it.
**Solution**: Added `getTenants` mock returning empty array in `app/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-detail-page.test.tsx:20-22`.

### Page Component Tests

- Added page-level tests for the main application routes, verifying that data is fetched and passed to the correct components.
- Each test mocks the relevant server actions (`getTenants`, `getRentPayments`, etc.) to isolate the page component.
- Covers both successful data fetching and error states.

**Test Files Created**:
- `app/tenants/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- `app/rent/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- `app/maintenance/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- `app/communications/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- `app/documents/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- `app/settings/__tests__/page.test.tsx`

### Component Tests

- Started testing of the `maintenance-form.tsx` component.
- Added tests for rendering in create and edit modes, validation errors, and cancel button functionality.

**Test File Created**:
- `components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-form.test.tsx`

## Problems That Still Exist

### 1. `MaintenanceForm` Submission Test Failing

**Location**: `components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-form.test.tsx`

**Error**: The `createMaintenanceRequest` mock function is not being called on form submission, even though the form appears to be filled out correctly in the test.

**How This Relates to New Code**: The new test for the maintenance form is failing. The form submission logic in `maintenance-form.tsx` is not behaving as expected in the test environment.

**Suggested Solutions**:

1.  **Inspect Form State**: The `react-hook-form` state (`formState`) might contain errors that are not being displayed. Logging `formState.errors` inside the `onSubmit` function could reveal hidden validation issues.
2.  **Debug `zodResolver`**: The issue might be with how `zodResolver` is processing the schema. It's possible a field is not being correctly transformed or validated, preventing the `handleSubmit` function from calling the `onSubmit` handler.
3.  **Check Event Propagation**: There might be an issue with how `userEvent` is simulating the form submission. Using `fireEvent.submit(formElement)` directly could be an alternative to clicking the submit button.

## What Was Tried

- **Selector Strategies**: Initially used `getByLabelText` which failed due to missing `for`/`id` attributes. Switched to `getByRole`, which also failed to find the elements by accessible name.
- **DOM Modifications**: Added `htmlFor` and `id` attributes to all form fields in `maintenance-form.tsx` to correctly associate labels with inputs.
- **Reverted Selectors**: After fixing the DOM, reverted the test to use `getByLabelText`, which is now working for selecting the elements.
- **Debugging Logs**: Added `console.log` statements to the `onSubmit` function in `maintenance-form.tsx` to inspect the form data and the result of the server action. The logs are not appearing in the test output, which suggests `onSubmit` is not being called.

## What Could Have Been Done

- **Mock Schema**: I could have tried mocking the `maintenanceRequestSchema` to rule out any issues with the Zod validation.
- **Isolate `react-hook-form`**: I could have created a minimal reproduction of the form with `react-hook-form` and the Zod schema in a separate test file to isolate the problem from the rest of the component's code.

## Next Recommended Actions

1.  **Continue Debugging**: The immediate next step is to resolve the failing test in `components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-form.test.tsx`. The suggestions above should be the starting point.
2.  **Complete Component Testing**: Once the form test is fixed, continue with the rest of the "Untested Application Components" as outlined in the `testing-roadmap.md`.
