# Server Action Test Expansion - November 1, 2025

**Session Goal**: Improve server action test coverage through edge case testing
**Actual Result**: 55.05% overall coverage (+1.45%), 76.78% server actions (+7.59%)
**Tests Added**: 10 new tests (233 → 243)
**Status**: All 243 tests passing ✅

---

## What Was Implemented

### Rent Server Actions Edge Case Tests
**Coverage Impact**: 57.5% → 100% for `app/actions/rent.ts`

Completely restructured and enhanced test suite with proper mocking strategy and comprehensive error path coverage.

**New Tests Added (10 total)**:

1. **getRentPayment** (3 new tests)
   - Fetch single payment by ID successfully
   - Return error when payment not found
   - Handle unexpected errors (connection failures)

2. **getRentPayments** (3 enhanced tests)
   - Database query failure handling
   - Unexpected error handling (catch block)
   - Overdue status calculation for pending payments past due date

3. **createRentPayment** (2 new tests)
   - Database insert failure error handling
   - Unexpected error handling

4. **updateRentPayment** (3 new tests)
   - Validation failure handling
   - Database update failure
   - Unexpected error handling

5. **deleteRentPayment** (2 new tests)
   - Database delete failure
   - Unexpected error handling

**Key Pattern Changes**:
- Switched from static module-level mock to dynamic per-test mocking
- Used `(createClient as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue()` for flexible mock configuration
- Added `beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks())` for test independence
- Tested both error paths (database errors) and exception paths (unexpected errors)

## Problems That Still Exist

### 1. Coverage Below 60% Target
**Current**: 55.05% | **Target**: 60% | **Gap**: 4.95%

**Root Cause**: Remaining server actions (tenants, maintenance, communications, documents) still have uncovered error paths similar to those just fixed in rent.ts.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Apply same testing pattern to other server actions (~30 tests, would add ~3-4%)
2. Add UI component interaction tests with userEvent (~15 tests, would add ~1.5%)
3. Accept 55% as sufficient for Phase 2, move to integration tests (Phase 3)

**Where to Look**:
- `app/actions/tenants.ts` lines 38-39, 45-46, 62-63 (error handlers)
- `app/actions/maintenance.ts` lines 62-63, 69-70, 95-96 (error handlers)
- `app/actions/documents.ts` lines 60-61, 67-68, 93-94 (error handlers)
- `app/actions/communications.ts` lines 55-56, 62-63, 88-89 (error handlers)

### 2. Inconsistent Mock Patterns Across Test Suites
**Issue**: Different test files use different mocking strategies (module-level vs per-test).

**Why This Exists**: Tests written at different times followed different patterns. Rent tests were updated, others weren't.

**Impact**: Makes tests harder to maintain and understand. Some tests may have shared state issues.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. **Standardize on per-test mocking** (recommended):
   - Update all server action tests to use `(createClient as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue()`
   - Add `beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks())`
   - More verbose but more flexible and maintainable

2. **Standardize on module-level mocking**:
   - Revert rent.ts tests to static mocks
   - Simpler but less flexible for edge cases

**Where to Look**:
- `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts` - Uses static module mock
- `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts` - Uses static module mock
- `app/actions/__tests__/documents.test.ts` - Uses static module mock
- `app/actions/__tests__/rent.test.ts` - Uses per-test mocking (NEW)

### 3. getRentPayment Not Tested in Original Suite
**Issue**: The `getRentPayment` function (single payment by ID) had no tests until this session.

**Why This Exists**: Likely added after initial test suite was created and tests weren't updated.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Audit other server action files for untested functions
2. Run coverage report and check for 0% line coverage functions
3. Add to testing checklist: "verify all exported functions have tests"

**Where to Look**:
- Run `npm run test:coverage` and review each file in `app/actions/`
- Check for functions with 0% coverage in lcov report

### 4. Overdue Status Calculation Not Previously Tested
**Issue**: Business logic in `mapDbToRentPayment` (lines 21-28 in rent.ts) that calculates overdue status was untested.

**Why This Exists**: Logic is inside a mapping function, easy to overlook when writing tests.

**Impact**: Critical business logic for determining payment status had no automated verification.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Test mapping functions directly, not just through higher-level functions
2. Extract complex mapping logic into separate testable functions
3. Add integration tests that verify status calculation with real date scenarios

**Where to Look**:
- `app/actions/rent.ts:16-42` - mapDbToRentPayment and mapDbToRentPaymentWithTenant
- Similar mapping functions in other server actions may have untested logic

## What Was Tried

### Successful Approaches
1. **Dynamic mocking per test** - Worked perfectly, allows flexible error scenario testing
2. **Testing both error types** - Database errors (Supabase returns `{data, error}`) AND exceptions (try/catch)
3. **Testing overdue calculation** - Used past date (2020-01-01) to verify status changes to 'overdue'
4. **Clear test structure** - Arrange-Act-Assert with descriptive test names

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Console.error output** - Error handlers log to console.error, causing verbose test output
   - Not a failure, just informational
   - Could suppress with `jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation()` if needed

---

## What Could Have Been Done (But Wasn't)

### 1. Update All Server Action Tests
**Time Constraint**: Would require ~2-3 hours to update all server action test files with same pattern.

**Approach Would Be**:
- Apply same refactoring to tenants, maintenance, documents, communications tests
- Add error path tests for all CRUD operations
- Would bring server actions from 76.78% to ~90%+

**Why Skipped**: Focused on demonstrating the pattern with one file (rent.ts) reaching 100% coverage. Others can follow same pattern incrementally.

### 2. Test Mapping Function Edge Cases
**Not Tested**:
- Null/undefined tenant info (what happens if `row.tenants` is null?)
- Invalid date formats in `due_date`
- Negative amounts or non-numeric values
- Very large amounts (overflow scenarios)

**Why Skipped**: Focused on error paths and critical business logic (overdue calculation) first.

### 3. Integration Tests for Rent Workflow
**Would Test**:
- Create payment → fetch payment → verify status calculation
- Payment becomes overdue after due date passes
- Update payment status → verify due date doesn't change
- Delete payment → verify cascade behavior

**Why Skipped**: Phase 3 work (roadmap), requires test database setup first.

### 4. Performance Tests for Large Datasets
**Would Test**:
- getRentPayments with 1000+ payments
- Memory usage during bulk operations
- Query optimization verification

**Why Skipped**: Phase 4 work, not critical at current scale.

## Next Steps to Reach 60%

### High Impact (Add 3-4% coverage) - 2-3 hours
1. **Apply rent.ts testing pattern to other server actions**
   - `app/actions/tenants.ts` - Add error path tests (~8 tests)
   - `app/actions/maintenance.ts` - Add error path tests (~8 tests)
   - `app/actions/documents.ts` - Add error path tests (~10 tests)
   - `app/actions/communications.ts` - Add error path tests (~8 tests)
   - **Estimated Impact**: +3-4% overall coverage

### Medium Impact (Add 1-2% coverage) - 1-2 hours
2. **Add user interaction tests to existing components**
   - Button clicks, form submissions with userEvent
   - Dialog open/close interactions
   - Select dropdown behavior
   - **Estimated Impact**: +1-2% overall coverage

### Alternative Approach
3. **Accept 55% and move to Phase 3 (Integration Tests)**
   - Current 76.78% server action coverage is strong
   - 55% overall is above Phase 2 target (50%)
   - Focus on integration tests for end-to-end workflows
   - **Reasoning**: Better ROI testing actual workflows vs chasing unit test percentage

## Files Modified

### Modified
- `app/actions/__tests__/rent.test.ts` - Complete restructure with 10 new edge case tests

### Not Modified (But Could Be)
- `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts`
- `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts`
- `app/actions/__tests__/documents.test.ts`
- `app/actions/__tests__/communications.test.ts`

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Dynamic mocking is more flexible** - Allows testing multiple error scenarios in same suite
2. **Test both error types** - Supabase error responses AND exception handling
3. **Business logic in mappers needs tests** - Don't skip over mapping functions
4. **100% coverage is achievable** - With systematic error path testing
5. **Pattern reusability** - rent.ts pattern can be applied to all server actions

---

## Testing Pattern Reference

For future server action tests, follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

jest.mock('@/lib/supabase/server', () => ({
  createClient: jest.fn(),
}))

describe('ServerAction', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks()
  })

  it('should handle database error', async () => {
    const mockSupabase = {
      from: jest.fn(() => ({
        select: jest.fn(() => ({
          data: null,
          error: { message: 'Database error' },
        })),
      })),
    };
    (createClient as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(mockSupabase)

    const result = await serverAction()

    expect(result.error).toBe('Database error')
  })

  it('should handle unexpected errors', async () => {
    (createClient as jest.Mock).mockRejectedValue(new Error('Connection failed'))

    const result = await serverAction()

    expect(result.error).toBe('Failed to ...')
  })
})
```

## Commands Run

```bash
npm test -- app/actions/__tests__/rent.test.ts  # Verify rent tests pass
npm test                                         # Run all tests (243 passing)
npm run test:coverage                            # Generate coverage report
```

**Final Status**: 243/243 tests passing ✅ | Coverage: 55.05% (target 60%, gap 4.95%)
