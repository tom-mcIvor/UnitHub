# Documents Server Action Edge Cases – November 1, 2025

**Session Goal**: Raise confidence in `app/actions/documents.ts` by covering failure modes and storage cleanup  
**Result**: Overall coverage 55.86% (+0.81%), server actions 83.7% (+6.92%), 255/255 tests passing ✅  
**Key Files**: `app/actions/__tests__/documents.test.ts`, `components/layout/__tests__/header.test.tsx`

---

## What Was Implemented

### Documents Server Actions (98.91% → near-100% statements)
- Rebuilt the suite with per-test Supabase/admin mocks to avoid shared state.
- Added success + error paths for every exported action:
  - `getDocuments` handles happy path, query failures, and unexpected rejects.
  - `getDocument` covers missing records and client creation failures.
  - `createDocument` asserts validation strings, Supabase insert errors, and unexpected rejects.
  - `updateDocument` verifies optional storage path handling and failure paths.
  - `deleteDocument` now checks storage cleanup success, Supabase failures, and resilience when storage removal throws.
- Ensured cache revalidation is asserted where appropriate and that storage removal only runs when the fetch succeeds.

### Header Test Stabilisation
- `components/layout/__tests__/header.test.tsx` now stubs `useRouter` and passes an `onMenuClick` handler so the App Router invariant no longer crashes the suite under coverage.

## Current Coverage Snapshot (after session)

| Area | Statements | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Overall | **55.86%** | +0.81% from documents edge cases |
| Server actions (`app/actions/**`) | **83.70%** | `documents.ts` at 98.91%, `rent.ts` at 100% |
| Documents server action file | **98.88% lines** | Remaining uncovered lines: `documents.ts:290` (storage cleanup guard) |

**Test Count**: 255 total (previously 243)  
**Command Used**: `npx jest --runInBand --coverage`

## Problems Still Present

### 1. Coverage Gap vs Target (55.86% vs 60%)
- Other server action suites (`tenants.ts`, `maintenance.ts`, `communications.ts`) still rely on legacy static mocks and miss failure branches.
- **Suggestions** *(may not be the final fix)*:
  1. Port this per-test mocking pattern to the remaining action suites to pick up ~3-4% statements. Look in `app/actions/__tests__/*`.
  2. Add interaction tests for shadcn/ui wrappers to nudge branches/lines (~1-2%). See `components/ui/__tests__/`.

### 2. Console Noise During Coverage
- Error-path tests intentionally trigger `console.error`, flooding the output.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Wrap error assertions with `jest.spyOn(console, 'error')` + `mockImplementation` per suite.
  2. Alternatively gate logs behind `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test')`.

### 3. Jest Worker Instability
- `npm run test:coverage` still crashes without `--runInBand`.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Update the `test`/`test:coverage` scripts to include `--runInBand`.
  2. Investigate memory usage or upgrade to Jest 30.3 when available.

### 4. Storage Cleanup Line 290 Uncovered
- Branch where storage removal throws is exercised, but the guard when `storage_path` is falsy still shows as uncovered.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Add a `deleteDocument` test where Supabase returns `storage_path: null`.
  2. Alternatively expose a helper to unit-test the guard without full mocks.

## What Was Tried

1. Ran `npx jest --runInBand --json` to verify per-test outcomes (255/255 passing).
2. Executed coverage with `npx jest --runInBand --coverage` because worker mode crashes.
3. Adjusted expectations to match `mapDbToDocument` (no tenant metadata on create/update responses).

---

## What Could Have Been Done (But Wasn’t)

1. **Refresh other server action suites** – time-boxed to documents only; tenants/maintenance/communications still need parity.
2. **Silence console noise** – left verbose for now to avoid hiding genuine failures.
3. **UI primitives interaction tests** – noted in roadmap but deferred; would improve low percentages across `components/ui/**`.

---

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Clone this dynamic-mock test pattern into `tenants.test.ts`, `maintenance.test.ts`, and `communications.test.ts`.
2. Add a `deleteDocument` test that returns `storage_path: null` to close the final uncovered line.
3. Update npm scripts to bake in `--runInBand` so contributors don’t hit worker crashes.
