## Problems That Still Exist

### 1. Component Tests Failing (0/22 passing)

**Location**:
- `components/tenants/__tests__/tenant-form.test.tsx`
- `components/tenants/__tests__/tenants-list.test.tsx`
- `components/rent/__tests__/rent-payment-form.test.tsx`
- `components/rent/__tests__/rent-tracking-page.test.tsx`

**Error**: `ReferenceError: Request is not defined`

**Root Cause**: Components import server actions → server actions import `next/cache` → `next/cache` requires Next.js server APIs (Request, Response) → jsdom environment doesn't provide these

**How This Relates to New Tests**: New server action tests work because they mock Supabase and next/cache at the module level before importing. Component tests fail because the component files import server action files directly, triggering the Request error before mocks can be applied.

**Suggested Solutions** (not guaranteed to work):

1. **Mock server actions before component import**
   ```typescript
   jest.mock('@/app/actions/maintenance', () => ({
     createMaintenanceRequest: jest.fn(),
     getMaintenanceRequests: jest.fn(),
   }))
   ```
   - Location: Top of component test files before imports
   - May require moving mock to separate setup file

2. **Refactor component architecture**
   - Separate container components (data fetching) from presentational (UI)
   - Move server action imports to page level
   - Pass functions as props to components
   - Location: `components/rent/*.tsx`, `components/tenants/*.tsx`

3. **Use E2E testing instead**
   - Install Playwright: `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`
   - Test components in real browser with actual server
   - Location: Create `tests/e2e/` directory
   - Config: `playwright.config.ts`

### 2. No Integration Tests

**What's Missing**: Tests that verify full request → database → response cycle

**How This Relates**: Server action tests mock Supabase, so actual database operations are never tested. No verification that:
- Database schema matches code expectations
- Foreign key constraints work correctly
- Database triggers/functions execute properly
- Concurrent operations handle correctly

**Suggested Solutions**:

1. **Set up test database**
   - Create separate Supabase project for testing
   - Or use Docker postgres container
   - Location: `docker-compose.yml` or separate Supabase project
   - Seed script: `tests/seed.sql`

2. **Integration test structure**
   - Location: `tests/integration/` directory
   - Test actual Supabase client calls
   - Clean up data after each test
   - Example pattern:
   ```typescript
   beforeEach(async () => {
     await seedDatabase()
   })
   afterEach(async () => {
     await cleanDatabase()
   })
   ```

### 3. No E2E Tests

**What's Missing**: Complete user journey tests in real browser

**How This Relates**: Unit tests verify individual functions work. No tests verify full workflows like:
- Login → Create Tenant → View List → Edit → Delete
- Record Payment → View in Dashboard → Filter by Status
- Create Maintenance Request → Assign Vendor → Mark Complete

**Suggested Solutions**:

1. **Playwright setup**
   - Install: `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`
   - Config: `playwright.config.ts`
   - Tests location: `tests/e2e/`
   - Example test pattern:
   ```typescript
   test('complete tenant workflow', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('/tenants')
     await page.click('text=Add Tenant')
     await page.fill('[name=name]', 'John Doe')
     // ... fill form
     await page.click('text=Submit')
     await expect(page.locator('text=John Doe')).toBeVisible()
   })
   ```

### 4. Missing Edge Case Tests

**What's Not Tested**:
- SQL injection attempts in text fields
- Extremely long input strings
- Special characters (unicode, emojis)
- Concurrent updates to same record
- Database constraint violations
- Network timeout scenarios
- Invalid UUIDs

**How This Relates**: Current tests only verify happy path and basic validation errors. No stress testing or security testing.

**Suggested Solutions**:

1. **Add edge case tests to existing files**
   - Location: `app/actions/__tests__/*.test.ts`
   - Example additions:
   ```typescript
   it('should handle SQL injection attempt', async () => {
     formData.append('name', "'; DROP TABLE tenants; --")
     const result = await createTenant(formData)
     expect(result.success).toBe(true) // Should be sanitized
   })

   it('should reject invalid UUID format', async () => {
     const result = await getTenant('not-a-uuid')
     expect(result.error).toBeDefined()
   })
   ```

## What Was Tried

**This Session**:
- Created 3 new test files following existing pattern from tenants.test.ts and rent.test.ts
- Verified all tests pass with `npm test`
- Created comprehensive testing documentation

**Previous Sessions** (from testing-implementation.md):
- Added TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills to jest.setup.js
- Attempted different assertion methods (toBeNull vs toBe(null))
- Changed component test assertions from getByLabelText to getByText
- Reorganized tests from root `__tests__/` to co-located structure

**Not Attempted This Session**:
- Fixing component test environment issues
- Setting up integration test database
- Installing Playwright for E2E tests
- Adding edge case tests
- Attempting deeper Next.js mocking

## What Could Have Been Done But Wasn't

### 1. Fix Component Tests
- Could have tried mocking server action modules at file level
- Could have created custom Jest environment with Request/Response polyfills
- Could have refactored components to separate concerns
- **Why not done**: Would require significant refactoring or complex mocking setup

### 2. Add Integration Tests
- Could have set up Docker postgres container
- Could have created Supabase test project
- Could have written seed/cleanup scripts
- **Why not done**: Requires infrastructure setup and environment configuration

### 3. Set Up E2E Testing
- Could have installed Playwright
- Could have written basic user journey tests
- Could have configured test environment variables
- **Why not done**: Requires deciding on E2E tool and initial setup time

### 4. Add Edge Case Tests
- Could have added SQL injection tests
- Could have tested invalid UUID handling
- Could have tested concurrent operations
- Could have tested large datasets
- **Why not done**: Would expand scope significantly, focused on completing base coverage first

### 5. Performance Testing
- Could have added benchmarks for server actions
- Could have tested with 1000+ records
- Could have profiled memory usage
- **Why not done**: Premature optimization without real usage data

### 6. CI/CD Integration
- Could have created GitHub Actions workflow
- Could have set up automatic test runs on PR
- Could have configured coverage reporting
- **Why not done**: Infrastructure concern separate from test creation

## Files Created

- `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts`
- `app/actions/__tests__/documents.test.ts`
- `app/actions/__tests__/communications.test.ts`
- `docs/testing-best-practices.md`

## Files Modified

None (only created new files)

## Next Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Fix component tests by mocking server actions at module level before imports
2. **Short-term**: Set up Playwright for E2E testing (most reliable for component testing)
3. **Medium-term**: Create integration tests with test database
4. **Long-term**: Add edge case coverage and performance tests

## Dependencies

Tests use existing dependencies:
- jest (30.2.0)
- @testing-library/react (16.3.0)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (6.9.1)

No new dependencies added.
