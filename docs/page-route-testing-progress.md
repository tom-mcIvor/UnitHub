# Page Route Testing Progress

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: âœ… Complete - All 115 tests passing

---

## Implemented

- Added unit tests for the dashboard page (`app/__tests__/dashboard-page.test.tsx`) that mock Supabase dashboard actions and verify props passed into `DashboardOverview` plus aggregated error handling.
- Created page-level tests for tenant and maintenance detail routes (`app/tenants/__tests__/tenant-detail-page.test.tsx`, `app/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-detail-page.test.tsx`) to confirm successful rendering with fetched records.
- Each page suite introduces a `notFound` scenario test to ensure missing records bubble up through Next.js' 404 boundary.
- Fixed `Request is not defined` errors by mocking form components (`TenantForm`, `MaintenanceForm`) in detail component tests.
- Corrected `.rejects.toThrowError()` to `.rejects.toThrow()` in page tests.
- Added `getTenants` mock to maintenance detail page test to match parallel data fetching.

## Issues Resolved

### Request is not defined
**Problem**: Detail components importing server action modules caused `Request is not defined` errors in Jest.
**Solution**: Mocked `TenantForm` and `MaintenanceForm` components in `components/tenants/__tests__/tenant-detail.test.tsx` and `components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-detail.test.tsx` to prevent importing server actions during component tests.

### notFound assertion errors
**Problem**: Page tests used `.rejects.toThrowError()` which doesn't exist in Jest.
**Solution**: Changed to `.rejects.toThrow('NOT_FOUND')` in both page test files.

### Missing getTenants mock
**Problem**: `MaintenanceDetailPage` now fetches tenants in parallel for edit dropdown, but test didn't mock it.
**Solution**: Added `getTenants` mock returning empty array in `app/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-detail-page.test.tsx:20-22`.

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 24 passed, 24 total
Tests:       115 passed, 115 total
Time:        6.2 s
```

## Next Steps

1. Add page tests for remaining routes (`/documents/[id]`, `/rent`, `/communications`).
2. Consider integration tests that verify full data flow without mocking server actions.
3. Increase coverage target from 26.7% toward 60-70% (see `docs/testing-roadmap.md`).
