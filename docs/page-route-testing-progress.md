# Page Route Testing Progress

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Scope**: Initial server-component page tests for dashboard, tenant detail, and maintenance detail routes

---

## Implemented

- Added unit tests for the dashboard page (`app/__tests__/dashboard-page.test.tsx`) that mock Supabase dashboard actions and verify props passed into `DashboardOverview` plus aggregated error handling.
- Created page-level tests for tenant and maintenance detail routes (`app/tenants/__tests__/tenant-detail-page.test.tsx`, `app/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-detail-page.test.tsx`) to confirm successful rendering with fetched records.
- Each page suite introduces a `notFound` scenario test to ensure missing records bubble up through Next.js’ 404 boundary.

---

## Current Issues

- **Missing global `Request` in Node tests**: Importing server actions (tenants/maintenance) pulls in Next.js internals that expect a Web `Request`. The new page tests (and existing maintenance/tenant component suites) crash with `ReferenceError: Request is not defined`.  
  *Suggestions*: extend `jest.setup.ts` to polyfill `Request` (e.g., via `undici` or a lightweight stub), or mock `next/cache`/Supabase clients directly inside the page tests so `createClient` isn’t invoked.

- **`expect(...).rejects` not usable on server components**: The `TenantDetailPage` “missing tenant” case currently throws synchronously, so `expect(...).rejects` fails. Need to wrap the call in `Promise.resolve().then(() => TenantDetailPage(...))` or capture the thrown `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error explicitly.  
  *Suggestions*: adjust the test to call the async component inside an `await expect(async () => TenantDetailPage(...)).rejects…` pattern, or refactor the page to throw inside a helper for easier assertions.

- **Tenant form suite recursion**: Once `Request` is missing, Next’s unhandled rejection hook keeps re-emitting errors, causing `Maximum call stack size exceeded` in `components/tenants/__tests__/tenant-form.test.tsx`. Fixing the global `Request` polyfill should unblock this.

---

## What Was Tried

- Ran `npm test -- --runInBand --detectOpenHandles`; dashboard page tests pass, while tenant/maintenance page tests and a few existing component suites fail due to the missing `Request` polyfill and the notFound assertion.
- Confirmed coverage still reports `26.7%` overall after adding the new specs (`npm run test:coverage -- --runInBand --detectOpenHandles`).

---

## Deferred / Next Steps

1. Update `jest.setup.ts` to polyfill `Request` (and potentially `Response`, `Headers`) so server actions can be imported safely in Jest.  
2. Refine the notFound assertions in page tests to assert on the thrown error rather than using `expect(...).rejects`.  
3. With the polyfill in place, re-run the existing component suites to verify the tenant/maintenance detail tests now execute.  
4. Expand page coverage once the above blockers are resolved (e.g., communications, documents, rent).
