# Tenants Server Action Edge Cases – November 1, 2025

**Session Goal**: Align `app/actions/tenants.ts` with the new per-test mocking pattern and cover failure paths  
**Result**: Overall coverage 56.84% (+0.98%), server actions 88.83% statements (+5.13%), 266/266 tests passing ✅  
**Key Files**: `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts`

---

## What Was Implemented

- Replaced the legacy static Supabase mock with a per-test factory that mirrors production behavior and avoids shared state.
- Added explicit coverage for:
  - `getTenants`: happy path, Supabase error, and `createClient` rejection.
  - `getTenant`: happy path, Supabase single error, and unexpected rejection.
  - `createTenant`: validation failure, Supabase insert error, and `createClient` rejection, plus success path verifying `revalidatePath`.
  - `updateTenant`: validation error, Supabase update error, unexpected rejection, and success covering dual revalidation.
  - `deleteTenant`: Supabase delete error, unexpected rejection, and success revalidation.
- Ensured validation assertions mirror the server action’s coercion of numeric fields before hitting Zod.

## Current Coverage Snapshot

| Area | Statements | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Overall | **56.84%** | +0.98% from tenants session |
| Server actions (`app/actions/**`) | **88.83%** | Tenants now 100% lines, 78.94% branches |
| `app/actions/tenants.ts` | **100% lines / statements** | Branch gaps remain in error logging (lines 20-21, 42, 66, 107-108, 163-164) |

**Test Count**: 266 total (+11)  
**Command Used**: `npx jest --runInBand --coverage`

---

## Problems Still Present

### 1. Coverage Gap vs 60% Target
- Overall coverage still short by ~3.16%.
- **Suggestions** *(may not be final fixes)*:
  1. Apply this refactor to `maintenance.test.ts` and `communications.test.ts` to lift server actions another ~2-3%.
  2. Add light interaction tests for key shadcn UI primitives to push statements closer to 60%.

### 2. Console Noise During Coverage Runs
- Exercising error branches emits `console.error`, cluttering CI logs.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Spy on `console.error` inside each suite and silence via `mockImplementation`.
  2. Introduce a logging helper that respects `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

### 3. Jest Worker Instability
- `npm run test:coverage` without `--runInBand` still crashes a worker.
- **Suggestions**:
  1. Update npm scripts to include `--runInBand`.
  2. Explore reducing `maxWorkers` or upgrading Jest once available.

---

## What Was Tried

1. Rebuilt the tenant suite with isolated mocks for each test case.
2. Ran `npx jest --runInBand` and `npx jest --runInBand --coverage` to verify stability and coverage.
3. Validated JSON output (`npx jest --runInBand --json`) showing 266/266 passing tests and zero failing suites.

---

## Deferred Work

1. Updating remaining server action suites (maintenance, communications) to the same pattern.
2. Capturing `console.error` output to reduce noise.
3. Adding a `deleteTenant` branch that simulates already-removed rows (Supabase returning success with no revalidation) for branch coverage.

---

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Port this mock pattern to `app/actions/__tests__/maintenance.test.ts` and `app/actions/__tests__/communications.test.ts`.
2. Update the npm test scripts to bake in `--runInBand` to avoid worker crashes for new contributors.
3. Add focused tests for shadcn UI wrappers used most heavily (e.g., `components/ui/select.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`) to keep pushing toward the 60% goal.
