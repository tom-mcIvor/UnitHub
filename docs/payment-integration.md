# Automatic Payment Tracking Integration

**Status:** Phase 2 / Stretch Goal
**Priority:** Medium-High (significant value add for users)

---

## Current State

UnitHub currently uses **manual payment tracking**:
- Property managers manually record when rent payments are received
- Users click "Record Payment" to log payment details
- No automatic bank account monitoring
- Tenants pay via their preferred methods (Venmo, Zelle, checks, direct bank transfers, etc.)

---

## Goal

**Automatically detect and track rent payments** that arrive in the property manager's bank account, regardless of how tenants choose to pay.

---

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Plaid Bank Integration (PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION)

**Overview:**
Connect the property manager's business bank account via Plaid to automatically detect and match incoming rent payments.

#### How It Works
1. Property manager connects their bank account through Plaid's secure interface
2. Plaid monitors transactions in real-time
3. When a payment comes in, the app matches it to the expected tenant rent (by amount, date, description)
4. Payment status automatically updates in UnitHub
5. Property manager receives notification of matched payments

#### Benefits
- No change to how tenants pay (they continue using Venmo, Zelle, checks, ACH, etc.)
- Automatic reconciliation saves time
- Real-time payment tracking
- Works with any bank that Plaid supports (covers 12,000+ institutions)

#### Costs
- **Plaid API**: ~$0.30-$1.00 per active user/month
- Transactions API pricing varies by volume

#### Technical Requirements
- Plaid API integration (plaid.com)
- Transaction matching algorithm
  - Match by amount and date range
  - Parse memo/description for tenant names or unit numbers
  - Fuzzy matching for partial matches
  - Manual review UI for uncertain matches
- Webhook handlers for real-time transaction updates
- Bank account connection UI in settings
- Transaction history display
- Manual override for incorrect matches

#### Implementation Complexity
- **Medium-High**: Requires secure financial data handling, matching logic, and transaction reconciliation

---

### Option 2: Manual CSV Import

**Overview:**
Property manager exports transaction data from their bank and uploads CSV files to match payments.

#### How It Works
1. Property manager downloads transactions from bank as CSV
2. Uploads CSV to UnitHub
3. App parses transactions and suggests matches to tenants
4. Property manager reviews and confirms matches
5. Payment statuses update in bulk

#### Benefits
- No API costs
- No sensitive bank credentials stored
- Simple fallback option
- Works with any bank

#### Costs
- **Free** (no external service fees)

#### Technical Requirements
- CSV file parser (support multiple bank formats)
- Transaction matching UI
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Match confirmation workflow
- Bulk payment updates

#### Implementation Complexity
- **Low-Medium**: Simpler than real-time integrations

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2A: Foundation (Quick Win)
1. Build CSV import as initial solution (low complexity, immediate value)
2. Validate transaction matching logic with real user data
3. Gather feedback on matching accuracy
4. Learn which transaction fields work best for matching

### Phase 2B: Plaid Integration (Full Automation)
1. Add Plaid for automatic bank monitoring
2. Reuse proven matching logic from CSV import
3. Add real-time webhook handling for instant updates
4. Build notification system for matched payments
5. Beta test with 5-10 property managers
6. Iterate based on matching accuracy feedback

---

## Security Considerations

### Plaid Integration
- Use Plaid Link for secure bank authentication (no bank credentials stored in UnitHub)
- Store only encrypted access tokens (encrypted at rest)
- Implement proper token rotation and refresh logic
- Follow PCI DSS guidelines for handling financial data
- Regular security audits
- Webhook signature verification for all incoming Plaid events
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### CSV Import
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Validate file format and size limits
- Delete CSV files after processing (don't store raw bank data)
- Sanitize all parsed data before database insertion

### General
- HTTPS only for all payment-related pages
- Audit logging for all payment transactions and matches
- Two-factor authentication for property managers
- Bank account connection requires re-authentication periodically (every 90 days)
- Never log or display full bank account numbers
- Role-based access control for multi-user accounts

---

## User Experience Considerations

### Plaid Flow (Initial Setup)
1. Navigate to Settings > Payment Tracking
2. Click "Connect Bank Account"
3. Select bank from Plaid's institution list (12,000+ banks)
4. Authenticate with bank credentials (via Plaid's secure UI - credentials never touch UnitHub)
5. Select account(s) to monitor (e.g., "Business Checking")
6. Configure matching preferences (auto-approve high confidence matches, or review all)
7. Complete setup

### Daily/Weekly Workflow (After Setup)
1. **Automatic matching**: When payment arrives, UnitHub receives transaction data from Plaid
2. **Smart matching**: App matches transaction to expected rent payment based on:
   - Amount (exact or within tolerance)
   - Date (within expected payment window)
   - Description/memo (tenant name or unit number)
3. **Notification**: Property manager receives notification with match details
4. **High confidence matches**: Automatically update status to "paid" (if enabled)
5. **Low confidence matches**: Display in "Review Needed" queue
6. **Manual review**: Property manager reviews uncertain matches, confirms or corrects
7. **Unmatched transactions**: Stored for later review or ignored

### CSV Import Flow
1. Navigate to Rent > Import Transactions
2. Download transactions from bank (CSV format)
3. Drag-and-drop or select file to upload
4. Review suggested matches
5. Confirm or adjust matches
6. Bulk update payment statuses

## Additional Notes

### Why This Approach vs. Payment Processing?

**Payment processing (Stripe, etc.) advantages:**
- Fully controlled payment flow
- Recurring payments built-in
- Tenant convenience (online portal)

**Payment processing disadvantages:**
- High transaction fees (2.9% + $0.30 per card, 0.8% ACH)
- Forces tenants to change payment habits
- Requires tenant onboarding/accounts
- Higher implementation complexity
- May reduce adoption (tenants resist new systems)

**Bank monitoring (Plaid) advantages:**
- Works with ANY payment method
- Much lower cost (~$0.50/user/month vs. % of transaction)
- No tenant friction or behavior change
- Simpler implementation
- Better fit for small landlords with existing tenant relationships

**Bank monitoring disadvantages:**
- Requires matching logic (not 100% automatic)
- Depends on transaction descriptions being useful
- No control over payment timing

**Conclusion**: For UnitHub's target market (small landlords, 10-50 units), bank monitoring is the better fit. These landlords already have established relationships and payment methods with tenants. They need better tracking, not payment processing.
