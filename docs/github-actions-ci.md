# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Partially functional (tests pass, build fails, code review blocked by API quota)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/node-ci.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` branch:
- Checks out code
- Sets up Node.js 20 with npm caching
- Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
- Runs linting (`npm run lint`)
- Runs tests (`npm test`)
- Builds Next.js app (`npm run build`)
- Uploads npm logs on failure

**Status**: Build step failing (see issues below)

### 2. Code Review Workflow (`.github/workflows/codex.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` branch:
- Checks out code with full git history
- Sets up Node.js 20 with npm caching
- Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
- Runs OpenAI Codex action with GPT-4o-mini model
- Outputs review results to GitHub Actions summary

**Configuration**:
- Uses `openai/codex-action@v1`
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret in repository settings

**Status**: Blocked by OpenAI API quota (requires billing setup)

### 3. Login Page Suspense Fix (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`)

Fixed Next.js build error by wrapping `useSearchParams()` in Suspense boundary:
- Created `LoginPageContent` component containing `useSearchParams()` logic
- Wrapped it in `<Suspense>` with loading fallback
- Export wrapped component as default

## Problems That Still Exist

### P0: Build Failing - Suspense Boundary Not Applied

**Error**: `useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/auth/login"`

**Root Cause**: The fix was committed locally (commit `980dc19`) but GitHub Actions runs the build BEFORE the changes were pushed. The error in the GitHub Actions log shows it's still using the old code without the Suspense wrapper.

**Evidence**:
- Local file `app/auth/login/page.tsx` contains the fix (lines 9-61, 63-69)
- Build error shows same error that was fixed

**What Was Tried**:
- Fixed the login page by wrapping `useSearchParams()` in Suspense
- Committed the fix (`980dc19`)
- Fix was pushed to GitHub

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Verify the push succeeded: `git log origin/main` should show commit `980dc19`
2. Check GitHub Actions is running on the latest commit
3. Wait for the new workflow run triggered by the push to complete
4. If still failing, check for caching issues in GitHub Actions

**Next Action**: Wait for current GitHub Actions run to complete and verify it uses commit `980dc19`

### P1: Code Review Blocked - OpenAI API Quota Exceeded

**Error**: `You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details`

**Root Cause**: OpenAI API requires separate billing from ChatGPT Plus subscription. No credits available on API account.

**What Was Tried**:
- Updated workflow to use `gpt-4o-mini` model (cost-efficient)
- Added `model` parameter to workflow configuration

**Required Actions** (not suggestions):
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method
3. Add credits (minimum $5)
4. Set usage limits to control costs

**Cost Implications**:
- Runs on every push to `main`
- Each code review costs a few cents to $1+ depending on code size
- Using `gpt-4o-mini` instead of `gpt-4` reduces cost significantly

**Alternative Suggestions** (if cost is a concern):
1. Change trigger to manual workflow dispatch only
2. Trigger only on pull requests (not direct pushes)
3. Use free alternatives: GitHub code scanning, SonarCloud, CodeQL
4. Remove the workflow entirely

### P2: Test Console Errors

**Error**: Multiple `console.error` outputs in test logs

**Root Cause**: Tests are intentionally testing error scenarios. The errors are EXPECTED and tests are passing (163/163).

**Why This Is Not a Problem**: These are captured error logs from testing error handling code paths. Jest captures console output from tests.

**Examples**:
- `app/api/ai/__tests__/suggest-vendor.test.ts:254` - Testing AI service unavailable scenario
- `app/actions/__tests__/dashboard.test.ts:237` - Testing database failure handling

**No Action Required**: These are expected test outputs.

### P3: Middleware Deprecation Warning

**Warning**: `The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead`

**Root Cause**: Next.js 16 deprecated `middleware.ts` in favor of `proxy.ts`

**Impact**: Low - warning only, functionality works

**Suggested Solution**:
1. Rename `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` (if it exists)
2. Update imports/references
3. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy

**What Could Have Been Done** (but didn't):
- Could have renamed middleware during this session
- Decided to focus on CI/CD setup instead

## What Could Have Been Done But Wasn't

1. **Created PR-based workflow** instead of push-based
   - Reason: User stated they don't use pull requests
   - Could implement trigger on both push and PR for flexibility

2. **Added test caching** to speed up CI runs
   - Reason: Time constraint
   - Would improve CI performance significantly

3. **Implemented branch protection rules**
   - Reason: Out of scope for initial setup
   - Recommended for production use

4. **Set up deployment workflow**
   - Reason: Focused on testing/review only
   - Should be next step after CI stabilizes

5. **Added code coverage reporting**
   - Reason: Already have local coverage, didn't add CI reporting
   - Could upload coverage to Codecov or similar

6. **Fixed middleware deprecation**
   - Reason: Low priority, just a warning
   - Should be addressed eventually

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/node-ci.yml` (created)
- `.github/workflows/codex.yml` (created)
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` (modified)

## Files That Should Exist But Don't

- `middleware.ts` or `proxy.ts` - Referenced in warning but may not exist

## Dependencies on External Services

1. **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repos, minutes-based pricing for private
2. **OpenAI API**: Requires billing setup, pay-per-token pricing
3. **npm registry**: For dependency installation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. Wait for GitHub Actions run to complete with latest commit
2. Verify build passes with Suspense fix
3. Add OpenAI API credits if code review is desired

### Short-term (Recommended)
1. Rename `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` if file exists
2. Add test caching to CI workflow
3. Consider changing code review to manual trigger
4. Set up branch protection rules

### Long-term (Optional)
1. Add deployment workflow (Vercel/other platform)
2. Add coverage reporting to CI
3. Implement PR-based workflows
4. Add pre-commit hooks for local validation
5. Set up Dependabot for dependency updates
