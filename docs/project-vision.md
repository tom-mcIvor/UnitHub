# Property Management App - Project Vision

## Target Market
**Small-to-medium residential property managers** managing 10-50 units

### Why This Niche?
- Underserved by current solutions
- Too sophisticated for free tools (TenantCloud, Cozy)
- Find enterprise solutions too expensive/complex (AppFolio, Buildium)
- Many still using spreadsheets
- Willing to pay for the right solution

## Core Features (MVP)

### Phase 1 - Must Have
- Tenant database with lease terms and contact info
- Rent tracking and payment reminders
- Maintenance request system (tenant submission + tracking)
- Document storage (leases, inspection reports, photos)
- Basic accounting (rent received, expenses, owner statements)
- Communication log with tenants

#### AI-Powered Features (Phase 1)
- **Maintenance Request Intelligence**: Auto-categorization, priority detection, cost estimation, vendor matching
- **Smart Document Extraction**: Auto-extract lease terms from uploaded documents (names, dates, rent, deposits, etc.)

_See [ai-features.md](./ai-features.md) for detailed AI implementation plan_

### Phase 2 - Can Wait
- Online rent payment processing
- Showing scheduler for vacant units
- Tenant screening integration
- Advanced financial reporting
- Mobile app

- **Vercel AI SDK** (AI integration with Next.js)

## Monetization Strategy

### Pricing Options
- **Option A:** $40-50/month per property manager (AI-powered, flat rate)
- **Option B:** $2-5/unit/month (scales with their business)

### Target: Start with Option A
- AI features justify premium pricing vs competitors
- Position as "AI-powered property management"
- Simpler billing than per-unit pricing

## Pre-Development Validation

### Before Building
1. Interview 10-15 property managers
2. Find them: Facebook groups, local real estate investor meetups, LinkedIn
3. Key questions:
   - What do you currently use?
   - What frustrates you most?
   - What features would you actually use?
   - Would you pay $X/month for this solution?

### Success Criteria
- At least 5 property managers express willingness to pay
- Clear pattern of pain points emerges
- Validation that proposed features solve real problems

## Competitive Landscape

### Enterprise (Expensive)
- AppFolio
- Buildium

### Free/Cheap (Limited)
- TenantCloud
- Cozy/Apartments.com

- Save hours per week on manual tasks
- Competitive advantage that justifies premium pricing
