# Google OAuth and Multi-Tenancy Implementation

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Status**: ✅ Completed and merged to main
**Branch**: feature/multi-tenancy-revert → main
**Tests**: 303/303 passing

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Multi-Tenancy with Row Level Security

Added user_id filtering to all data tables to ensure users only access their own data.

**Database Changes** (`scripts/01-init-schema.sql`):
- Added `user_id UUID` columns to: tenants, rent_payments, maintenance_requests, documents, communication_logs
- Added foreign key constraints: `REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Created indexes on all user_id columns for query performance
- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Created RLS policies: `CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own data" ... USING (auth.uid() = user_id)`

**Server Action Updates**:
All server actions now include auth checks:
```typescript
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (!user) return { success: false, data: null, error: 'User not authenticated' }
// All queries now include: .eq('user_id', user.id)
```

Files modified:
- `app/actions/tenants.ts` - All 5 functions (getTenants, getTenant, createTenant, updateTenant, deleteTenant)
- `app/actions/maintenance.ts` - All maintenance functions
- `app/actions/communications.ts` - All communication functions
- `app/actions/documents.ts` - Verified existing auth checks
- `app/actions/rent.ts` - Verified existing auth checks
- `app/actions/dashboard.ts` - Added auth checks to all 4 dashboard functions

### 2. Google OAuth Integration

Implemented Google sign-in and sign-up alongside email/password authentication.

**New Components**:
- `components/auth/sign-up-form.tsx` - New SignUpForm component with:
  - Google OAuth button
  - Email/password signup with confirmation
  - Dialog switching support (onSwitchToSignIn prop)
  - Same auth state listener pattern as SignInForm

**Updated Components**:
- `components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx`:
  - Added Google OAuth button with SVG icon
  - Added `onSwitchToSignUp` prop for dialog mode
  - Added `handleGoogleSignIn()` function using `signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`

**OAuth Callback Handler**:
- Created `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Route handler for OAuth redirects
- Deleted `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` - Removed to avoid routing conflict
- Callback exchanges code for session using `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)`
- Redirects to home on success, login with error message on failure

**Dashboard Integration**:
- `components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx`:
  - Added state for switching between sign-in and sign-up: `const [showSignUp, setShowSignUp] = useState(false)`
  - Conditional rendering: `{showSignUp ? <SignUpForm /> : <SignInForm />}`
  - Added accessible DialogTitle for screen readers

### 3. Flash Rendering Fix

**Problem**: Auth dialogs briefly appeared and immediately closed when user was already authenticated.

**Root Cause**: Both SignInForm and SignUpForm were checking `supabase.auth.getSession()` on mount and immediately calling `onSignedIn()` callback if a session existed.

**Solution**: Removed the `getSession()` check. Now components only use `onAuthStateChange` listener:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const { data: listener } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event) => {
    if (event === 'SIGNED_IN') {
      onSignedIn?.()
    }
  })
  return () => {
    listener?.subscription.unsubscribe()
  }
}, [onSignedIn, supabase])
```

This fires only on NEW sign-in events, not existing sessions.

Files modified:
- `components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx:39-53`
- `components/auth/sign-up-form.tsx:43-53`

### 4. Test Updates

**Dashboard Tests** (`app/actions/__tests__/dashboard.test.ts`):
- Added `auth.getUser()` mock to `buildSupabaseMock()` function
- Updated all query mocks to support `.eq()` chaining for user_id filtering
- Added `.eq()` method to success path mocks: tenantsSelect, rentPaymentsSelect, maintenanceSelect
- Added `auth: baseSupabase.auth` to error case mocks
- All 8 dashboard tests now passing

**Dashboard Layout Tests** (`components/layout/__tests__/dashboard-layout.test.tsx`):
- Added mock for `@/components/auth/sign-up-form`
- Added DialogTitle to Dialog mock
- All 2 layout tests now passing

## Current State

### ✅ Working
- All 303 tests passing (58 test suites)
- Google OAuth sign-in/sign-up functional (after .env.local configuration)
- Multi-tenancy auth checks in all server actions
- Flash rendering issue resolved
- Dialog switching between sign-in and sign-up

### ⚠️ Requires User Action
User must run this SQL migration in Supabase dashboard to add user_id columns and RLS policies:
```sql
-- See full migration in scripts/01-init-schema.sql lines 49-98
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
-- ... (repeat for all tables)
```

Without this migration, dashboard queries will fail with "column user_id does not exist" errors.

### 🔧 Configuration Required
`.env.local` must have correct Supabase URL:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://iwsuwkvndrtkfzmbpmsg.supabase.co
```

Google OAuth credentials must be configured in Supabase dashboard:
- Authentication > Providers > Google
- Add OAuth client ID and secret from Google Cloud Console

## Problems and Limitations

### 1. Database Schema Not Auto-Applied
**Problem**: The SQL migration in `scripts/01-init-schema.sql` is not automatically applied to Supabase.

**Why This Matters**:
- Existing users will get errors when trying to use the app after this update
- Dashboard queries fail with "column does not exist" errors
- Google sign-in succeeds but user can't access any data

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. **Migration Tool** (recommended for production): Use a database migration tool like Drizzle, Prisma Migrate, or Supabase CLI migrations
2. **Manual Application**: Document the manual SQL execution step in deployment guide
3. **Seed Script**: Create a setup script that checks for user_id columns and applies migration if missing

**Where to Look**:
- `scripts/01-init-schema.sql:49-98` - The migration that needs to be applied
- Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor - Where user must manually run it

### 2. No Migration for Existing Data
**Problem**: Existing tenant/payment/maintenance records have no user_id value.

**Why This Matters**: After migration, existing records become invisible (user_id = NULL doesn't match any user).

**What Was Tried**: Nothing yet - this is a known limitation of the current implementation.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. **Data Migration Script**: Create script to assign existing records to the first authenticated user
2. **Admin User Assignment**: Provide UI for user to claim existing orphaned records
3. **Default User**: During migration, set all existing records to a specific user_id

**Where to Look**:
- Need to create: `scripts/02-assign-existing-data.sql`
- Consider adding to `app/settings/page.tsx` - Admin section to claim orphaned data

### 3. Google OAuth Redirect URL Configuration
**Problem**: OAuth redirect URL must exactly match between Google Cloud Console and application.

**Why This Matters**: Mismatch causes "redirect_uri_mismatch" error from Google.

**What Was Tried**: Set redirectTo to `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback` in both SignInForm and SignUpForm.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. **Document Required URLs**: Add to README the exact callback URLs to configure
2. **Environment Variable**: Make callback URL configurable via .env
3. **Multiple Environments**: Document how to set up dev/staging/prod callbacks in Google Console

**Where to Look**:
- `components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx:86` - redirectTo configuration
- `components/auth/sign-up-form.tsx:94` - redirectTo configuration
- Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs

### 4. No Error Boundary for Auth Failures
**Problem**: If Supabase auth service is down, entire app becomes unusable.

**Why This Matters**: No graceful degradation - users see cryptic errors or blank screens.

**What Could Be Done** (but wasn't):
1. Add React Error Boundary around auth components
2. Implement offline mode with cached credentials
3. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Show user-friendly error messages

**Where to Look**:
- `components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Could wrap Dialog with ErrorBoundary
- `app/error.tsx` - Could be created to handle auth errors

## Testing Requirements

### New Tests Needed

**Auth Components**:
- [ ] `components/auth/__tests__/sign-up-form.test.tsx`:
  - Google OAuth button click
  - Email/password validation (passwords must match)
  - onSignedUp callback after successful signup
  - onSwitchToSignIn callback
  - Error states (signup failure, Google OAuth failure)
  - Loading states during signup

- [ ] `components/auth/__tests__/sign-in-form.test.tsx`:
  - Google OAuth button click (now added)
  - onSwitchToSignUp callback (now added)
  - Test that getSession is NOT called on mount (regression test for flash rendering)

**OAuth Callback**:
- [ ] `app/auth/callback/__tests__/route.test.ts`:
  - Successful code exchange redirects to home
  - Failed code exchange redirects to login with error
  - Missing code parameter handling
  - Invalid code handling

**Multi-Tenancy**:
- [ ] All server action tests should verify user_id filtering (already done for dashboard)
- [ ] Integration test: Create tenant as User A, verify User B cannot see it
- [ ] Integration test: Attempt to access another user's data via direct URL

**RLS Policy Testing**:
- [ ] Direct database query tests to verify RLS prevents cross-user access
- [ ] Test CASCADE DELETE works when user account is deleted

See `docs/testing-roadmap.md` for full testing plan.

## What Could Have Been Done

### 1. Automatic Database Migrations
Could have integrated Drizzle or Prisma for schema version management. Didn't pursue because:
- Adds complexity to project setup
- Requires additional dependencies
- Manual SQL is more transparent for learning purposes

### 2. OAuth Provider Abstraction
Could have created a generic OAuth provider component to easily add Microsoft, GitHub, etc. Didn't because:
- Google OAuth was the only immediate requirement
- Premature abstraction could make code harder to understand
- Easy to add more providers later following the same pattern

### 3. Refresh Token Handling
Could have implemented explicit refresh token logic. Didn't because:
- Supabase client handles this automatically
- Would add complexity without clear benefit
- Current implementation works for typical session durations

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Could have added MFA support. Didn't because:
- Not a stated requirement
- Supabase supports it but requires additional UI flows
- Can be added incrementally later

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)
1. **Run Database Migration**: User must execute SQL from `scripts/01-init-schema.sql` in Supabase
2. **Configure Google OAuth**: Add credentials to Supabase dashboard
3. **Test End-to-End**: Sign up → Sign in → Create tenant → Verify isolation

### Short Term (Recommended)
1. Create data migration script for existing records
2. Add auth error boundaries
3. Write missing test suites (auth components, OAuth callback)
4. Document OAuth setup in README

### Long Term (Nice to Have)
1. Implement automatic database migrations
2. Add more OAuth providers (GitHub, Microsoft)
3. Add MFA support
4. Create admin panel for orphaned data management
