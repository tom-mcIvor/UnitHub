# Communications CRUD + Lint Tooling Update

## What Changed
- Enabled edit flow inside `components/communications/communication-form.tsx` by reusing the existing create modal, switching to `updateCommunicationLog` when `editingLog` is present, and updating copy/states to reflect edit mode.
- Added edit controls to `components/communications/communications-page.tsx`, wiring timeline rows to open the modal with populated data while keeping the existing Supabase-backed delete confirmation.
- Installed `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `globals`, and `typescript-eslint`, then introduced a flat `eslint.config.js` so `npm run lint` executes against the current Next.js + TypeScript stack.

## Current Issues
- `components/communications/communications-page.tsx:53` still accepts an `error` prop from the server component that is never rendered, so lint surfaces an unused-variable warning tied to this file.
- Documents module still relies on the placeholder upload flow—metadata editing now works, but there is no real file upload or download piping yet.
- Running ESLint also flags other legacy warnings (for example `app/layout.tsx:7`), which are outside today’s changes but now visible because linting is enabled.

## Suggestions (Verify First)
- Either render the `error` message or drop the prop in `components/communications/communications-page.tsx` and the corresponding server component to clear the warning.
- Replace the placeholder upload approach with a Supabase-backed storage flow that captures `fileUrl` automatically during create/edit; `components/documents/document-upload.tsx` is the right entry point.
- Review the newly enabled lint output and address remaining warnings one by one; start with the unused `geistMono` font import in `app/layout.tsx`.

## What Was Tried
- Installed the missing ESLint-related devDependencies and ran `npm run lint`, confirming the tool now executes.
- Verified that edit and delete actions for communications refresh the list via `router.refresh()` after the mutation.

## Deferred Work
- No updates were made to the communications detail page (`/communications/[id]`) because it still operates on mock data and requires a larger refactor.
- Did not tackle the outstanding lint warnings outside the communications module to keep this change focused.
