# Test Coverage Expansion - November 1, 2025

**Session Goal**: Increase test coverage from 49.03% to 60%+
**Actual Result**: 53.6% coverage (+4.57%)
**Tests Added**: 36 new tests (197 → 233)
**Status**: All 233 tests passing ✅

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. App Layout Tests (app/__tests__/layout.test.tsx)
**Coverage Impact**: 0% → 87.5% for app/layout.tsx

Created 3 tests covering:
- Root layout rendering children correctly
- Multiple children handling
- Toaster component inclusion (sonner portal)

**Note**: RTL doesn't render actual `<html>` and `<body>` tags in isolation, so tests focus on children rendering and error-free execution. Console warning about HTML nesting is expected behavior in test environment.

### 2. Dashboard Layout Wrapper Tests (app/(dashboard)/__tests__/layout.test.tsx)
**Coverage Impact**: 0% → 100% for app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx

Created 2 tests covering:
- DashboardLayout component wrapping
- Multiple children pass-through

Uses mock for DashboardLayout component to isolate wrapper logic from complex sidebar/header rendering.

### 3. Dynamic Document Page Tests (app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/__tests__/page.test.tsx)
**Coverage Impact**: 0% → 90% for documents/[id]/page.tsx

Created 5 tests covering:
- Successful document rendering with tenant data
- notFound() call when document doesn't exist
- notFound() call on fetch error
- Empty tenant list handling
- Parallel data fetching (Promise.all verification)

**Pattern**: Tests async server component with Promise-based params (Next.js 15+ requirement).

### 4. Document Download API Route Tests (app/api/documents/[id]/download/__tests__/route.test.ts)
**Coverage Impact**: 0% → ~75% for download route.ts

Created 6 tests covering:
- Missing document ID (400 error)
- Document not found (404 error)
- Missing storage path (404 error)
- Storage download failure (500 error)
- Unexpected errors (500 error with catch block)
- Correct storage bucket usage verification

**Limitations**: Could not test successful download with response headers due to NextResponse constructor not available in Jest environment. Tests focus on error paths and method call verification instead.

**What Was Tried**:
- Mock Blob objects → TypeError in Jest
- Mock NextRequest → Not a constructor in jsdom
- Create custom Request mock → Works for error paths only

**What Works**: Error handling, validation, storage client method calls all testable and covered.

### 5. UI Primitives Smoke Tests (components/ui/__tests__/ui-primitives.test.tsx)
**Coverage Impact**: 4.45% → ~15% for components/ui/**

Created 16 tests covering 14 UI components:
- Button (variants: default, destructive, outline)
- Input (placeholder, value)
- Label
- Card (with all subcomponents: Header, Title, Description, Content, Footer)
- Badge (variants)
- Skeleton
- Separator
- Table (Header, Body, Row, Head, Cell)
- Textarea
- Checkbox
- Switch
- Select (Trigger, Value, Content, Item)
- Dialog (Trigger, Content, Header, Title)
- Tabs (List, Trigger, Content)

**Pattern**: Smoke tests verify components render without crashing. Not testing internal Radix UI logic (library responsibility), only ensuring wrappers work correctly.

## Problems That Still Exist

### 1. Coverage Below 60% Target
**Current**: 53.6% | **Target**: 60%+ | **Gap**: 6.4%

**Root Cause**: Large number of UI primitive components with 0% coverage dragging down overall percentage.

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Add interaction tests for frequently-used UI primitives (Dialog, Select, Form)
- Test auth pages (app/auth/** currently 0%)
- Add server action edge case tests (currently 69%, can reach 90%+)
- Test error boundaries and loading states

**Where to Look**:
- `components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Dialog open/close interactions
- `components/ui/select.tsx` - Select dropdown behavior
- `components/ui/form.tsx` - Form field rendering
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Auth flow
- `app/actions/*.ts` - Add edge cases (concurrent ops, race conditions)

### 2. UI Primitive Full Coverage Challenge
**Issue**: 50+ UI components in `components/ui/**`, many never directly imported in tests.

**Why This Exists**: shadcn/ui generates many components, but not all are used yet. Coverage report includes all files.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. **Pragmatic**: Focus on components actually used in app (grep for imports)
2. **Comprehensive**: Create comprehensive UI test suite (time-intensive)
3. **Ignore Pattern**: Add unused components to coverage ignore patterns

**Where to Look**:
- `components/ui/**` - Run `git grep "from '@/components/ui"` to find usage
- `.gitignore` or `jest.config.js` - Add coveragePathIgnorePatterns if needed

### 3. NextResponse Constructor Not Available in Tests
**Issue**: Cannot test successful API route responses that use `new NextResponse()` with headers.

**What Was Tried**:
- Creating mock NextResponse → TypeError
- Using Blob objects → Not a function in Jest
- Importing from 'next/server' → Not a constructor

**Current Workaround**: Test error paths (NextResponse.json works) and verify method calls, skip testing binary response with headers.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Mock NextResponse constructor in jest.setup.ts (requires understanding internal Next.js structure)
2. Test only error paths (current approach)
3. Use integration tests with real server for success paths

**Where to Look**:
- `jest.setup.ts` - Add NextResponse mock
- `app/api/ai/test-utils.ts` - Reference existing mock patterns
- Consider Playwright/integration tests for full API route testing

### 4. HTML Nesting Warning in Layout Tests
**Issue**: Console warning "In HTML, <html> cannot be a child of <div>" when testing RootLayout.

**Why This Exists**: RTL renders components in a test container (div), but RootLayout returns `<html>`. This is expected in test environment.

**Impact**: None - warning only, tests pass correctly.

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Ignore warning (current approach - it's expected behavior)
2. Suppress console.error in test setup for this specific warning
3. Test layout logic separately from HTML structure

**Where to Look**:
- `app/__tests__/layout.test.tsx` - Tests pass despite warning
- `jest.setup.ts` - Could add console.error suppression if needed

## What Could Have Been Done (But Wasn't)

### 1. Comprehensive UI Primitive Testing
**Time Constraint**: Would require ~2-3 hours to properly test all 50+ UI components.

**Approach Would Be**:
- Test each variant of each component
- Test keyboard navigation (accessibility)
- Test ARIA attributes
- Test component composition

**Why Skipped**: Diminishing returns - most UI primitives are Radix wrappers with minimal custom logic. Focused on app-specific coverage instead.

### 2. Integration Tests
**Not Started**: Would test full user flows across components/pages/actions.

**Would Include**:
- Document upload → save → download flow
- Tenant create → rent payment → reminder generation
- Maintenance request → AI categorize → assign vendor

**Why Skipped**: Phase 3 work (roadmap), requires test database setup first.

### 3. Auth Page Tests
**Coverage Impact**: Would add ~3-4% to overall coverage.

**Would Test**:
- Login form rendering
- Signup form validation
- Callback page redirect logic

**Why Skipped**: (Update 2025-11-XX) Auth now uses the in-house `SignInForm` component rendered both as a modal overlay and on the login route. New tests should cover the header trigger → dialog behavior and form submission states. Historical rationale retained for context.

### 4. Document Download Success Path
**Blocked By**: NextResponse constructor issue (see Problem #3).

**Would Test**:
- Correct MIME type in Content-Type header
- Filename sanitization in Content-Disposition
- Cache-Control header set to no-store
- Binary buffer returned correctly

**Why Skipped**: Technical blocker, error paths provide sufficient validation coverage.

## Next Steps to Reach 60%

### High Impact (Add 5-7% coverage)
1. **Test more UI primitives** - Focus on Dialog, Select, Form (most used)
   - `components/ui/__tests__/dialog.test.tsx`
   - `components/ui/__tests__/select.test.tsx`
   - `components/ui/__tests__/form.test.tsx`

2. **Add server action edge cases** (69% → 85%+)
   - Concurrent operation tests
   - Validation boundary tests
   - Database constraint tests

### Medium Impact (Add 2-3% coverage)
3. **Auth pages** (`app/auth/**`)
   - Login page rendering
   - Signup form validation
   - Callback page logic

4. **More component interactions**
   - User event flows
   - Form submission error handling
   - Modal open/close state

### Low Impact (Add 1-2% coverage)
5. **Error boundaries**
6. **Loading states**
7. **Middleware tests** (if testable)

### Time Estimates
- **Option A** (Quick to 60%): Focus on #1 and #2 → 2-3 hours
- **Option B** (Comprehensive): All of above → 6-8 hours
- **Option C** (Roadmap Phase 3): Continue to integration tests → 1-2 weeks

- `app/__tests__/layout.test.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/__tests__/layout.test.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- `app/api/documents/[id]/download/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- `components/ui/__tests__/ui-primitives.test.tsx`

## Key Learnings

1. **RTL with Next.js Layouts**: Can't test HTML structure, focus on children and behavior
2. **API Route Testing Limits**: NextResponse constructor unavailable in Jest, test error paths
3. **UI Primitive Coverage**: Large component count impacts percentage, focus on usage
4. **Async Server Components**: Use Promise.resolve() for params in tests (Next.js 15+)
5. **Coverage vs Value**: 60% with good test quality > 80% with shallow smoke tests

## Testing Best Practices Followed

✅ Co-located tests in `__tests__/` directories
✅ Descriptive test names ("should X when Y")
✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
✅ Mock external dependencies (Supabase, Next.js router)
✅ Test behavior, not implementation
✅ Independent tests (no shared state)
✅ Fast execution (~14s for 233 tests)

---

## Commands Run

```bash
npm test                    # Verify all tests pass
npm run test:coverage       # Generate coverage report
```

**Final Status**: 233/233 tests passing ✅ | Coverage: 53.6%
