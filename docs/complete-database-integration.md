# Complete Database Integration Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: All core features connected to Supabase database

---

## What Was Implemented

### Server Actions Created
Created four new server action files following the pattern established in `/app/actions/tenants.ts`:

1. **`/app/actions/rent.ts`** (267 lines)
   - `getRentPayments()` - Fetches all rent_payments with JOIN to tenants table
   - `getRentPayment(id)` - Fetches single payment by UUID
   - `createRentPayment(formData)` - Inserts new payment record
   - `updateRentPayment(id, formData)` - Updates existing payment
   - `deleteRentPayment(id)` - Deletes payment by UUID
   - Returns `RentPaymentWithTenant` type (includes tenantName, unitNumber)

2. **`/app/actions/maintenance.ts`** (285 lines)
   - `getMaintenanceRequests()` - Fetches all maintenance_requests with JOIN
   - `getMaintenanceRequest(id)` - Fetches single request
   - `createMaintenanceRequest(formData)` - Inserts new request
   - `updateMaintenanceRequest(id, formData)` - Updates request
   - `deleteMaintenanceRequest(id)` - Deletes request
   - Returns `MaintenanceRequestWithTenant` type

3. **`/app/actions/documents.ts`** (246 lines)
   - `getDocuments()` - Fetches all documents with optional JOIN to tenants
   - `getDocument(id)` - Fetches single document
   - `createDocument(formData)` - Inserts document metadata (no file upload)
   - `updateDocument(id, formData)` - Updates document metadata
   - `deleteDocument(id)` - Deletes document record
   - Returns `DocumentWithTenant` type (tenantName/unitNumber optional)

4. **`/app/actions/communications.ts`** (239 lines)
   - `getCommunicationLogs()` - Fetches all communication_logs with JOIN
   - `getCommunicationLog(id)` - Fetches single log
   - `createCommunicationLog(formData)` - Inserts new log
   - `updateCommunicationLog(id, formData)` - Updates log
   - `deleteCommunicationLog(id)` - Deletes log
   - Returns `CommunicationLogWithTenant` type

### Pages Converted to Server Components
Modified five page components to fetch data server-side:

- `/app/rent/page.tsx` - Added `getRentPayments()` and `getTenants()` calls
- `/app/maintenance/page.tsx` - Added `getMaintenanceRequests()` and `getTenants()`
- `/app/documents/page.tsx` - Added `getDocuments()` and `getTenants()`
- `/app/communications/page.tsx` - Added `getCommunicationLogs()` and `getTenants()`
- `/app/tenants/page.tsx` - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

All pages pass `initialData`, `tenants`, and `error` props to client components.

### Client Components Updated
Modified eight client components to accept database props:

**Page Components**:
- `/components/rent/rent-tracking-page.tsx` - Removed mock data (lines 17-62 deleted)
- `/components/maintenance/maintenance-page.tsx` - Removed mock data (lines 18-79 deleted)
- `/components/documents/documents-page.tsx` - Removed mock data (lines 18-73 deleted)
- `/components/communications/communications-page.tsx` - Removed mock data (lines 16-67 deleted)

**Form Components**:
- `/components/rent/rent-payment-form.tsx` - Added `createRentPayment()` integration, tenant dropdown uses real data
- `/components/maintenance/maintenance-form.tsx` - Added `createMaintenanceRequest()` integration, tenant dropdown uses real data
- `/components/communications/communication-form.tsx` - Added `createCommunicationLog()` integration, tenant dropdown uses real data

All forms now:
- Accept `tenants: Tenant[]` prop
- Show error/success messages
- Call `router.refresh()` after save
- Auto-close modal 1 second after success

### Dynamic Rendering Configuration
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all database-dependent pages to prevent static generation errors during build.

## Problems That Still Exist

### 1. Update and Delete Operations Not Implemented
**Location**: All list/table components
**Issue**: Edit and Delete buttons exist in UI but have no onClick handlers or functionality.

**Affected Files**:
- `/components/tenants/tenants-list.tsx:106-111` - Edit/Delete buttons not wired
- `/components/rent/rent-tracking-page.tsx` - No edit/delete UI for payments
- `/components/maintenance/maintenance-page.tsx` - No edit/delete UI for requests
- `/components/documents/documents-page.tsx` - No delete UI for documents
- `/components/communications/communications-page.tsx` - No delete UI for logs

**Related Server Actions** (exist but unused):
- `/app/actions/tenants.ts:122-156` - `updateTenant()` not called
- `/app/actions/tenants.ts:159-183` - `deleteTenant()` not called
- `/app/actions/rent.ts:158-217` - `updateRentPayment()` not called
- `/app/actions/rent.ts:220-247` - `deleteRentPayment()` not called
- `/app/actions/maintenance.ts:189-252` - `updateMaintenanceRequest()` not called
- `/app/actions/maintenance.ts:255-282` - `deleteMaintenanceRequest()` not called
- `/app/actions/documents.ts:150-202` - `updateDocument()` not called
- `/app/actions/documents.ts:205-229` - `deleteDocument()` not called
- `/app/actions/communications.ts:145-197` - `updateCommunicationLog()` not called
- `/app/actions/communications.ts:200-224` - `deleteCommunicationLog()` not called

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Add `handleDelete` function in page components that calls delete server action
- Add confirmation dialog before delete (could use shadcn/ui AlertDialog)
- For edit: Add `editingId` state and pass to form component
- Forms need `initialData` prop to distinguish create vs update mode
- Pass record ID to form for update operations

### 2. Tenant Detail Pages Not Updated
**Location**: `/app/tenants/[id]/page.tsx`, `/app/maintenance/[id]/page.tsx`
**Issue**: Detail view pages still use mock data or show no data.

**Related Code**:
- `/app/actions/tenants.ts:48-69` - `getTenant(id)` exists but not called from detail page
- `/app/actions/maintenance.ts:75-103` - `getMaintenanceRequest(id)` exists but not called

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Convert detail pages to async Server Components
- Call `getTenant(params.id)` or `getMaintenanceRequest(params.id)`
- Pass data as props to detail view client component

### 3. File Upload Not Implemented
**Location**: `/components/documents/document-upload.tsx`
**Issue**: Form exists but does not upload files to Supabase Storage.

**Current State**:
- Form has TODO comment for API call
- `createDocument()` expects `fileUrl` but no mechanism to generate it
- Database schema has `file_url` column (TEXT)

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Create Supabase Storage bucket in dashboard
- Add file upload in `document-upload.tsx` using `supabase.storage.from('bucket').upload()`
- Get public URL after upload: `supabase.storage.from('bucket').getPublicUrl()`
- Pass file URL to `createDocument()`
- Consider adding file size/type validation

### 4. No Authentication System
**Location**: All pages and server actions
**Issue**: No user sessions, anyone can access all data.

**Security Implications**:
- All server actions use `createClient()` from `/lib/supabase/server.ts` without auth checks
- No middleware to protect routes
- No Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- No `user_id` column in any table

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Enable Supabase Auth in dashboard
- Create `/middleware.ts` to check session with `supabase.auth.getUser()`
- Add `user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)` to all tables
- Add RLS policies: `WHERE user_id = auth.uid()`
- Create login/signup pages using Supabase Auth

### 5. Dashboard Shows Hardcoded Stats
**Location**: `/app/page.tsx` (dashboard)
**Issue**: Dashboard not updated to fetch real statistics from database.

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Create server action to aggregate stats (COUNT queries)
- Fetch stats server-side in dashboard page
- Pass to dashboard components as props

### 6. No Server-Side Validation
**Location**: All server actions
**Issue**: Server actions trust FormData without re-validation.

**Current State**:
- Client-side validation via Zod in forms
- Server actions only check for required field presence (if statements)
- No format validation (email, phone, dates) on server

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Import Zod schemas from `/lib/schemas.ts` into server actions
- Parse FormData: `const parsed = schema.parse(Object.fromEntries(formData))`
- Catch ZodError and return validation errors
- Located at: `/app/actions/rent.ts:108-116`, `/app/actions/maintenance.ts:125-134`, etc.

### 7. No Loading States
**Location**: All pages
**Issue**: Pages show nothing while fetching data from database.

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Add `/app/[route]/loading.tsx` files with skeleton UI
- Use Suspense boundaries for granular loading
- Example: `/app/tenants/loading.tsx` with table skeleton

### 8. Payment Status Not Auto-Updated
**Location**: `/app/actions/rent.ts`
**Issue**: Rent payments don't automatically change from "pending" to "overdue" based on date.

**Current State**:
- Status stored as string in database
- No cron job or trigger to update overdue payments

**Suggested Solutions**:
- Calculate status dynamically in `getRentPayments()` based on `due_date` vs current date
- Or: Create Supabase database function to compute status
- Or: Use Supabase Edge Function scheduled daily

## What Was Tried

### Lockfile Conflict Resolution
- Found both `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package-lock.json`
- Deleted `pnpm-lock.yaml` to use npm exclusively
- Verified with `ls -lh package-lock.json`

### Build Verification
- Ran `npm run build` to check TypeScript errors
- Encountered "Dynamic server usage" warnings for all database pages
- Fixed by adding `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to page files
- Build succeeded with all routes marked as dynamic (Æ’ symbol)

---

## What Was Not Attempted

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Toast notifications**: sonner library already installed but not configured
- **Confirmation dialogs**: No "Are you sure?" before deletes
- **Optimistic updates**: Could use `useOptimistic` hook for instant UI feedback
- **Loading spinners**: Forms show "Saving..." text but no spinner component

### Data Features
- **Pagination**: All lists fetch all records, no limit/offset
- **Real-time updates**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions not configured
- **Search debouncing**: Search filters trigger on every keystroke
- **Bulk operations**: No multi-select or "Delete selected" functionality

### Edge Cases
- **Duplicate detection**: No check for duplicate email/unit before insert
- **Cascade implications**: Foreign key CASCADE deletes work but no warning to user
- **Empty states**: "No data" messages exist but could be more actionable
- **Date validation**: No check that lease_end > lease_start

### AI Feature Integration
- **OpenAI API**: No `OPENAI_API_KEY` in .env.local
- **Lease extraction**: UI component exists but not connected to `/app/api/ai/extract-lease`
- **Maintenance categorization**: API route exists but not called from form

### Type Safety
- **Generated types**: Not using `supabase gen types typescript` for database schema types
- **Zod from database**: Could generate Zod schemas from Supabase schema
