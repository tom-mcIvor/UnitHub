**All Tests**: ✅ Passing (163/163)

---

## What Was Implemented

### New Test Suites Created (5 files, 21 tests)

1. **`components/settings/__tests__/settings-page.test.tsx`** (5 tests)
   - Renders page title and description
   - Renders API integrations section (OpenAI, Stripe, Supabase)
   - Renders feature status section (AI Lease Extraction, Maintenance Categorization, Payment Reminders)
   - Renders account settings section (Company Name, Email, Phone)
   - Renders danger zone section (Delete Account)
   - **Coverage**: 100% for settings component

2. **`components/rent/__tests__/rent-chart.test.tsx`** (4 tests)
   - Renders monthly income chart
   - Renders payment status distribution chart
   - Handles empty payments array
   - Filters payments by status correctly
   - **Note**: Recharts library is mocked to avoid rendering complexity
   - **Coverage**: Rent components now at 60.71% (was 54.28%)

3. **`components/__tests__/theme-provider.test.tsx`** (2 tests)
   - Renders children correctly
   - Wraps children in theme provider
   - **Coverage**: 100% for theme provider

4. **`components/communications/__tests__/communications-page.test.tsx`** (5 tests)
   - Renders page title ("Communication Log")
   - Renders add communication button ("Log Communication")
   - Shows empty state ("No communications found")
   - Renders communications when provided
   - Shows error message when provided
   - **Coverage**: Communications components now at 47.74% (was 0%)

5. **`components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-page.test.tsx`** (5 tests)
   - Renders page title ("Maintenance Requests")
   - Renders create request button ("New Request")
   - Shows empty state (table header row)
   - Renders requests when provided
   - Shows error message when provided
   - **Coverage**: Maintenance components now at 75.3% (was 53.08%)

### Code Changes Made

**Added prop defaults to prevent undefined errors**:

1. **`components/communications/communications-page.tsx`**:
   ```typescript
   export function CommunicationsPage({
     initialCommunications = [],
     tenants = [],
     error = null
   }: CommunicationsPageProps)
   ```

2. **`components/maintenance/maintenance-page.tsx`**:
   ```typescript
   export function MaintenancePage({
     initialRequests = [],
     tenants = [],
     error = null
   }: MaintenancePageProps)
   ```

**Why**: These components call `.filter()` on their props. Without defaults, tests crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')".

---

## Problems That Still Exist

### 1. Coverage at 36.57% (Target: 60%+)

**Gap**: Need +23.43 percentage points to reach 60% target.

**Where the Gaps Are**:
- **Document components**: 0% (5 files completely untested)
- **Server actions**: 69.19% (target 100%, missing edge cases and error paths)
- **Communication components**: 47.74% (communication-form.tsx untested)
- **Rent components**: 60.71% (payment-reminder-generator.tsx untested)
- **UI components**: 4.07% (low priority - third-party shadcn components)

**Impact**: Test suite doesn't catch bugs in:
- File upload workflows (documents)
- AI integration features (lease extraction, payment reminders)
- Communication form validation
- Server action error handling

### 2. Document Components Untested (Highest Priority Gap)

**Files at 0% coverage**:
- `components/documents/document-upload.tsx` - File upload with Supabase storage
- `components/documents/documents-page.tsx` - List and filtering
- `components/documents/lease-extractor.tsx` - AI integration with simulated delays
- `components/documents/document-form.tsx` - Metadata editing
- `components/documents/document-detail.tsx` - Document viewing

**Why Untested**: Previous attempt (Session 1) showed these are difficult to test:
- Supabase storage client mocking is brittle
- File upload interactions (`userEvent.upload()`) have assertion issues
- AI components with `setTimeout` cause timer conflicts in Jest
- Complex form validation (React Hook Form + Zod)

**Estimated Impact**: Testing these would add ~5-8% to overall coverage.

### 3. Server Actions Missing Edge Case Coverage

**Current**: 69.19% coverage
**Target**: 100%
**Missing**:
- Database constraint violations (duplicate keys, foreign key errors)
- Invalid UUID format handling
- Network timeout scenarios
- Supabase service errors
- Edge cases (empty strings, special characters, boundary values)

**Where to Look**:
- `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts` - Has good patterns for happy path
- Need to add tests for error paths: database errors, validation failures, constraint violations

**Estimated Impact**: Would add ~4-6% to overall coverage.

### 4. No Integration or E2E Tests

**Problem**: All tests are unit tests. No tests verify:
- Complete workflows (create tenant → add rent payment → view dashboard)
- Database integration (real Supabase queries)
- File upload → storage → download workflow
- AI API calls (currently mocked)

**Impact**: Tests can pass but app can still fail in production due to:
- Database schema mismatches
- Supabase RLS policy issues
- File storage configuration problems
- API integration failures

**Where to Look**: `docs/testing-roadmap.md` Phase 3 (Integration Testing)

## Suggested Solutions (Not Guaranteed to Work)

### To Reach 60% Coverage

**Option 1: Simple Smoke Tests for Document Components** (Easiest, 2-3 hours)
- Test only that components render without errors
- Don't test file upload interactions
- Don't test AI integration timing
- Mock Supabase storage client at module level
- **Pros**: Quick, stable, adds ~3-4% coverage
- **Cons**: Doesn't catch real bugs in file upload/AI logic

**Option 2: Add Server Action Edge Cases** (Medium, 3-4 hours)
- Test each server action with invalid inputs
- Test database error scenarios
- Test constraint violations
- **Where to Start**: Copy pattern from `app/actions/__tests__/tenants.test.ts`, add error cases
- **Estimated Coverage Gain**: +3-4%

**Option 3: Test Communication Form** (Medium, 2-3 hours)
- Use patterns from `components/tenants/__tests__/tenant-form.test.tsx`
- Test basic rendering, validation errors, submission
- Avoid testing complex React Hook Form internals
- **Estimated Coverage Gain**: +1-2%

**Option 4: Focus on Integration Tests Instead** (Hard, 1-2 weeks)
- Set up test database (Supabase local or Docker PostgreSQL)
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- **Where to Look**: `docs/testing-roadmap.md` Phase 3
- **Pros**: Higher value, catches real bugs
- **Cons**: More infrastructure, doesn't boost unit test coverage metric

**Recommended**: Combination of Options 1, 2, and 3 to reach 60%, then move to Option 4 for real value.

### Specific Component Testing

**Document Upload** (`components/documents/document-upload.tsx`):
- Create reusable mock: `tests/utils/supabase-mocks.ts` with storage client mock
- Query by role (`screen.getAllByRole('combobox')`) instead of labels
- Don't test actual file upload, just verify form renders and button states
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  jest.mock('@/lib/supabase/client', () => ({
    createClient: () => ({
      storage: {
        from: () => ({
          upload: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ error: null }),
          getPublicUrl: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
            data: { publicUrl: 'https://test.com/file.pdf' }
          }),
        }),
      },
    }),
  }))
  ```

**Lease Extractor** (`components/documents/lease-extractor.tsx`):
- Use `jest.useFakeTimers()` with proper cleanup
- Call `jest.advanceTimersByTime(2000)` to skip simulated delay
- Don't test actual AI extraction, just verify loading states
- **Example from previous attempt**: Check `docs/test-expansion-2025-11-01.md` "What Was Tried" section

**Server Action Edge Cases**:
- Add tests like this to each action file:
  ```typescript
  it('should return error when database constraint is violated', async () => {
    mockSupabase.from().insert.mockResolvedValue({
      error: { code: '23505', message: 'duplicate key value' },
      data: null,
    })

    const result = await createTenant(formData)

    expect(result.success).toBe(false)
    expect(result.error).toContain('already exists')
  })
  ```

---

## What Was Tried (This Session)

### Successful Approaches

1. **Smoke Tests with Simple Assertions**
   - Tested only that components render
   - Checked for key text elements
   - Avoided complex interactions
   - **Result**: All 163 tests passing, stable test suite

2. **Mocking Complex Dependencies**
   - Mocked `recharts` to avoid rendering complexity
   - Mocked `next-themes` for theme provider
   - **Result**: Tests run fast, no flakiness

3. **Adding Prop Defaults Before Testing**
   - Added defaults to communications-page and maintenance-page
   - Prevented undefined filter errors
   - **Result**: Tests pass reliably

4. **Checking Component Source for Exact Text**
   - Read component files to find actual button/heading text
   - Used exact text from components in assertions
   - **Result**: Tests match reality, fewer failures

5. **Flexible Assertions**
   - Used regex: `screen.getByText(/error loading/i)`
   - Used partial matches when text is split
   - Verified structure (table, roles) instead of exact text in cells
   - **Result**: Tests more resilient to copy changes

### Unsuccessful Approaches (Avoided Based on Session 1 Lessons)

1. **Complex File Upload Testing**: Not attempted (learned from Session 1)
2. **Timer-Based AI Component Tests**: Not attempted (caused timeout issues in Session 1)
3. **Testing Text Split Across DOM Elements**: Avoided by using flexible queries
4. **Query by Label Associations**: Used role queries instead

## What Could Have Been Done (But Wasn't)

### 1. Create Test Utility Library

**What**: Create `tests/utils/test-helpers.ts` with reusable utilities

**Would Include**:
- `mockSupabaseStorage()` - Consistent storage client mock
- `mockFetch(response)` - Standardized fetch mock for AI endpoints
- `renderWithRouter(component)` - Render with Next.js router mocked
- `setupUser()` - Configure userEvent with common options

**Why Not Done**: Time constraint, unclear if these would be reused enough

**Where to Start**: Look at `app/api/ai/test-utils.ts` for existing pattern

### 2. Test Document Components with Smoke Tests

**What**: Add basic rendering tests for all 5 document components

**Why Not Done**: Wanted to focus on components that would definitely work

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

**Estimated Coverage Gain**: +3-4%

### 3. Increase Server Action Coverage to 100%

**What**: Add edge case and error path tests to all server actions

**Why Not Done**: Time constraint, wanted to show progress on untested components

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

**Estimated Coverage Gain**: +4-6%

### 4. Test Auth Pages

**What**: Test login, signup, callback pages

**Why Not Done**: Lower priority, auth is provided by Supabase

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

**Estimated Coverage Gain**: +1-2%

## Testing Patterns Established

### Pattern 1: Smoke Test for Page Components

```typescript
describe('ComponentPage', () => {
  it('should render page title', () => {
    render(<ComponentPage items={[]} error={null} />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Page Title')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should show empty state', () => {
    render(<ComponentPage items={[]} error={null} />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/no items found/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should show error message', () => {
    render(<ComponentPage items={[]} error="Database error" />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/error/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Pattern 2: Mock Complex Dependencies

```typescript
// Mock recharts to avoid rendering complexity
jest.mock('recharts', () => ({
  BarChart: ({ children }: any) => <div data-testid="bar-chart">{children}</div>,
  Bar: () => null,
  XAxis: () => null,
  // ... other exports as null or simple divs
}))
```

### Pattern 3: Add Prop Defaults

```typescript
// Before (crashes on undefined)
export function Component({ items, error }: Props) {
  const filtered = items.filter(...)  // Error if items is undefined
}

// After (safe with defaults)
export function Component({
  items = [],
  error = null
}: Props) {
  const filtered = items.filter(...)  // Always works
}
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Simple smoke tests are better than complex brittle tests** - Focus on stability
2. **Add prop defaults before writing tests** - Prevents undefined errors
3. **Check component source for exact text** - Avoid assumption-based assertions
4. **Mock complex dependencies** - Recharts, timers, file uploads are hard to test
5. **Use flexible queries** - Regex, partial matches, role-based queries
6. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Don't test internal state, test user-visible outcomes

The test suite is stable, maintainable, and ready for continued expansion toward the 60% coverage target.
