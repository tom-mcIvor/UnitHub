# Authentication Implementation and Test Suite Fixes (2025-11-01)

## Completed Changes

### Test Suite Fixed (136/137 tests passing - 99.3%)
Fixed critical test failures:
- **Removed duplicate code** in `app/actions/tenants.ts` (lines 129-228 were duplicated outside function)
- **Fixed API routes** to use `NextResponse` instead of `Response` for Next.js compatibility
- **Added Response mock** in `jest.setup.ts` for test environment
- **Fixed validation tests** by handling `parseFloat(undefined)` which returns NaN
- **Fixed test data** in `tenants.test.ts` and `maintenance-form.test.tsx` (phone numbers, priority field)

### Automatic Payment Status Updates
Implemented dynamic status calculation in `app/actions/rent.ts`:
- Payments with status "pending" are automatically computed as "overdue" when due_date has passed
- No cron jobs or scheduled functions needed - calculated on every fetch
- Status is computed in the `mapDbToRentPayment` function

## Existing Problems

1.  **Incomplete Authentication:** The current implementation is not secure. There are no RLS policies, no `user_id` columns in the database tables, and the server actions are not scoped to the authenticated user.
2.  **One failing UI test:** `components/maintenance/__tests__/maintenance-form.test.tsx` has async timing issues (not critical - core functionality works)
3.  **Missing Edit/Delete UI:** While server actions exist for update/delete operations, the UI components for editing and deleting records need to be added to all feature pages

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1.  **Add Edit and Delete UI** to all feature pages (rent, maintenance, documents, communications)
2.  **Add toast notifications** using the already-installed `sonner` library for better user feedback
3.  **Complete Authentication Implementation:**
    *   Add a `user_id` column to all relevant database tables
    *   Enable and configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
    *   Update all server actions to use the authenticated user's ID to scope database queries
