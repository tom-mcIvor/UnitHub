# Authentication Implementation and Next Steps (2025-11-01)

## Implemented Changes

I have implemented a basic authentication flow using Supabase Auth. This includes:

*   **Authentication Middleware:** A `middleware.ts` file has been created to protect all routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page.
*   **Authentication Pages:** Basic login, signup, and email confirmation callback pages have been created under `/app/auth`.

## Existing Problems

Despite the progress on authentication, several critical issues remain:

1.  **Incomplete Authentication:** The current implementation is not secure. There are no RLS policies, no `user_id` columns in the database tables, and the server actions are not scoped to the authenticated user.
2.  **Broken Test Suite:** The test suite is still failing, which prevents me from verifying the quality and stability of the application.
3.  **Deprecated Middleware Convention:** The `middleware.ts` file is using a deprecated Next.js convention.

## Suggested Solutions

1.  **Complete Authentication:**
    *   Add a `user_id` column to all relevant database tables.
    *   Enable and configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase.
    *   Update all server actions to use the authenticated user's ID to scope database queries.
2.  **Fix the Test Suite:**
    *   Address the syntax errors and other issues that are causing the test runner to crash.
    *   Fix the individual test failures.
3.  **Update Middleware:**
    *   Rename `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` and update the code to use the new `proxy` convention.

## What I Tried

*   I have implemented the basic authentication flow with login, signup, and callback pages.

## What Could Have Been Done

*   I could have used the Supabase UI library to create more polished authentication forms.
*   I could have added support for social login providers.

## Next Steps

1.  **Fix the Test Suite:** This is the most critical next step. A stable test suite is essential for ensuring the quality of the application.
2.  **Complete the Authentication Implementation:** This includes adding `user_id` columns, enabling RLS, and updating server actions.
3.  **Update the Middleware:** Address the deprecated `middleware` convention.
